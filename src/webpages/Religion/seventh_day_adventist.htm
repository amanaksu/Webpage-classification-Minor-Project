 <h2>What is Seventh-day Adventism? </h2>
<p>The <strong>Seventh-day Adventist Church</strong> (abbreviated <strong>SDA</strong>) is a  denomination that grew out of the prophetic Millerite movement in the  United States during the middle part of the 19th century. It considers  itself a branch of Protestant Christianity, though differences in  doctrine and practice have led some mainstream Christians to dispute that  designation. </p>

    </div>

   
  <p>The name of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination  indicates its two main distinctive characteristics: Sabbath observance on the seventh day (i.e., Saturday) and an  expectation that the end of the world is drawing near. </p>
<p>Other  distinguishing characteristics include adherence to the teachings of  <strong>Ellen G. White</strong> (who is regarded as a prophe), and various dietary  observances rooted in Jewish law. </p>
<p>As of 2005, the  Seventh-day Adventist Church had 12 million baptized members and about  25 million total members and adherents worldwide. The Seventh-day  Adventist Church is one of the world's fastest-growing organizations,  primarily due to increases in Third World membership. It now operates in  203 out of 228 countries recognized by the United Nations.</p>

</div> <p>The  Adventist movement has its roots in the 19th-century "Millerite  movement," which centered on the belief that Jesus would return on  October 22, 1844. <strong>William Miller</strong> (1782-1849) was a farmer who settled  in upstate New York after the war of 1812. He was originally a Deist,  but after much private Bible study, Miller converted to Christianity  and became a Baptist. He was convinced that the Bible contained coded  information about the end of the world and the Second Coming of Jesus.  In 1836, he published the book <em>Evidences from Scripture and History of the Second Coming of Christ about the Year 1843</em>.</p>
<p>The  prediction of the year 1843 was based in large part on Daniel 8:14:  "And he said onto me, unto 2,300 days, then shall the sanctuary be  cleansed." Miller believed the "2,300 days" referred to 2,300 years and  that the countdown began in 457 BC. He concluded that the "cleansing of  the sanctuary" (interpreted as the Second Coming) would occur sometime  between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844. </p>
<p>When these dates  passed, Samuel Snow, a follower of Miller, interpreted the "tarrying  time" referred to in Habakkuk 2:3 as equal to 7 months and 10 days,  thus delaying the end time to October 22, 1844. When this date also  passed uneventfully, many followers left the movement in what is now  termed "The Great Disappointment." Miller himself gradually withdrew  from the leadership of the group and died in 1849. </p>
<p>Miller's  followers who remained in the movement called themselves Adventists,  and taught that the expectation had been fulfilled in a way that had  not previously been understood. Further Bible study led to the belief  that Jesus in that year had entered into the Most Holy Place of the  heavenly sanctuary, and began an "investigative judgment" of the world:  a process through which there is an examination of the heavenly records  to "determine who, through repentance of sin and faith in Christ, are  entitled to the benefits of His atonement" after which time Jesus will  return to earth. According to the church's teaching, the return of  Christ may occur very soon, though nobody knows the exact date of that  event (Matthew 24:36). </p>
<p>For about 20 years, the Adventist  movement was a rather unorganized group of people who held to this  message. Among its greatest supporters were James White, Ellen G. White  and Joseph Bates. Later, a formally organized church called the General  Conference of Seventh-day Adventists was established in Battle Creek,  Michigan, on May 21, 1863, with a membership of 3,500. </p>
<p>Primarily  through the evangelism and inspiration of Ellen G. White, who was  regarded as a prophet, the church quickly grew and established a  presence beyond North America during the later part of the 1800s. In  1903, the denominational headquarters were moved from Battle Creek to  Washington D.C. and the neighboring community of Takoma Park, Maryland. </p>
<p>In 1929, a new sect was formed by Victor Houteff, whose  beliefs differed from mainline Adventist teachings. The sect was called  the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists. This group further subdivided into  other groups that included the Students of the Seven Seals, popularly  known as the Branch Davidians. This off-shoot of the Seventh-day  Adventist movement, which became widely known due to David Koresh and  1993 Waco, Texas conflagration, held very little in common with the  rest of Adventism. </p>
<p>In 1989, the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church was moved  to Silver Spring, Maryland. </p>
<h2><a name="beliefs"></a>Seventh-day Adventist Beliefs</h2>
<p>Seventh-day  Adventist doctrine is rooted in the Anabaptist Protestant tradition.  Adventist doctrine resembles mainstream orthodox trinitarian Protestant  theology, with a few exceptions such as the following. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adventism</strong>.  Belief in an imminent, pre-millennial, universally visible second  advent, preceded by a time of trouble when the righteous will be  persecuted and a false second coming where Satan impersonates the  Messiah. </li>
<li><strong>Ellen G. White</strong>.  Teaching that the "Spirit of Prophecy," an identifying mark of the  remnant church, was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White, whom  Adventists recognize as the Lord's messenger. Her "writings are a  continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the  church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction."(28 Fundamental  Beliefs) They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which  all teachings and experience must be tested. </li>
<li><strong>State of the dead</strong>.  Seventh-day Adventists believe that death is a sleep during which the  "dead know nothing" (Ecclesiastes 9:5). This view maintains that the  person has no conscious form of existence until the resurrection,  either at the second coming of Jesus (in the case of the righteous) or  after the millennium of Revelation 20 (in the case of the wicked).  Because of this view, Seventh-day Adventists do not believe hell  currently exists and believe further that the wicked will be destroyed  at the end of time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists oppose  the formulation of credal statements and prefer to  view the fundamental beliefs as descriptors rather than prescriptors.  However, divergence from the published position is frowned upon.</p>
<h2><a name="practices"></a>Seventh-day Adventist Practices </h2>
<p>Seventh-day  Adventists observe a 24-hour sunset-to-sunset Sabbath commencing Friday  evening. Justification for this belief is garnered from the creation  account in Genesis in which God rested on the seventh day, an approach  later immortalised in the Ten Commandments. Seventh-day Adventists  maintain that there is no biblical mandate for the change from the  "true Sabbath" to Sunday observance, which is to say that  Sunday-keeping is merely a "tradition of men." </p>
<p><strong>Church services</strong> follow an evangelical format, with emphasis placed on the sermon.  During the week prayer meetings may be conducted and children often  attend Adventist schools.</p>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists practice <strong>adult baptism</strong> by full immersion in a similar manner to the Baptists. Infants are  dedicated rather than baptized, as it is argued that baptism requires  consent and moral responsibility.</p>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists practice <strong>communion</strong> four times a year, reflecting their Methodist roots. The communion is  an open service (available to members and non-members) and includes a  foot-washing ceremony (commonly referred to as the Ordinance of  Humility) and consumption of the Lord's Supper. </p>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists <strong>do not eat pork</strong> or other unclean meat as identified in the book of Leviticus and many avoid all meat for health reasons (see next section). </p>
<p> <strong>Missionary outreach</strong> of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is aimed at  both unbelievers and other Christian churches. </p>
<h2><a name="health"></a>Seventh-day Adventist Health Code and Dietary Restrictions </h2>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists present a health message that recommends <strong>vegetarianism</strong> and condones abstinence from <strong>pork</strong>, shellfish, and other foods proscribed as "unclean" in Leviticus. Alcohol and tobacco are also prohibited. </p>
<p>Dr.  John Kellogg, founder of the Kellogg's company and a major supplier of  breakfast cereals, was a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The  Sanitarium Health Food Company, owned by the Seventh-day Adventist  Church, is one of Australia's leading manufacturers of health and  vegetarian-related products. </p>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists run a  large number of hospitals. Their predominant school of medicine in  North America is located in Loma Linda, California. </p>
<h2><a name="ethics"></a>Seventh-day Adventist Ethical Views </h2>
<p>The official Seventh-day Adventist position on <strong>abortion</strong> is that it is permissable only in exceptional circumstances that  present serious moral or medical dilemmas, such as significant threats  to the pregnant woman's life, serious jeopardy to her health, severe  congenital defects carefully diagnosed in the fetus, and pregnancy  resulting from rape or incest. While the general tone toward abortion  is negative, the individual Adventist may take any position on the  political spectrum. Abortions are performed in Adventist hospitals. </p>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists generally condemn <strong>homosexuality</strong>.  The church does not perform gay marriages or holy unions, and gay men  cannot be ordained. Homosexuality of a spouse is given as one of the  rare acceptable reasons for divorce. The official statement on  sexuality states that sexual acts outside of heterosexual marriage are  forbidden. However, individual Adventists may take a much more liberal  position. </p>

<h2><a name="org"></a>Seventh-day Adventist Organization and Structure </h2>
<p>Seventh-day  Adventists have three levels of ordination: deacons, elders, and  pastors. In some Adventist churches only men are eligible for  ordination but there are many examples of deaconesses and female elders  and pastors. Male pastors are allowed to marry and have families. </p>
<p>Organization beyond the local church is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>The global church is called the General Conference. </li>
<li>The General Conference is made up of divisions. </li>
<li>Divisions are comprised of union conferences. </li>
<li>Union conferences consist of local conferences. </li>
<li>Local conferences include local church districts. These are generally ministered to by one pastor each. </li>
<li>Local  districts can contain one to many local churches (congregations). In  the United States, these numbers tend to be smaller (2-4 churches per  district, perhaps), while in most of the worldwide church, the numbers  tend to be larger (5+ per district and per pastor, sometimes as many as  15 or more). </li>
</ul>
<p> Adventist Church governance, is a  mixture of episcopal and presbyterian elements. Each of these local  churches has its own elected governing body and office. Almost  everything is decided by either elected committees, through vote of  members, or representatives from the local churches. Each organization  holds a general session at certain intervals. This is usually when  general decisions get voted on. The president of the General  Conference, for instance, is elected at the General Conference Session  every five years. The current head of the Seventh-day Adventist Church  is General Conference President Jan Paulsen from Norway. </p>
<p>Churches  are governed by a church board formed by members of that church, with  the pastor of that congregation. Church property is owned by the  conference corporation though, and so this differs from congregational  polity. Ministers are ordained by ministers as are lay elders and lay  deacons (which is presbyterian rather than congregational or  episcopal). </p>
<h2><a name="inst"></a>Seventh-day Adventist Education and Institutions</h2>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists have had a long interest in <strong>education</strong>.  The Adventist church runs one of the largest education systems in the  world. They operate some 5,700 pre-schools, primary and secondary  schools, as well as colleges, universities, seminaries and medical  schools in about 145 countries worldwide. This education system  involves some 66,000 teachers and 1,257,000 students. The Adventist  educational program is comprehensive encompassing "mental, physical,  social, and spiritual health" with "intellectual growth and service to  humanity" its goal. </p>
<p>The Youth Department of the Seventh-day Adventist church runs an organisation for 10-16 year old boys and girls called <strong>Pathfinders</strong>.  For younger children, Adventurer, Eager Beaver, and Little Lambs clubs  are available that feed into the Pathfinder program. Pathfinders is  similar to the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), except that membership is  open to both boys and girls. </p>
<p>Seventh-day Adventists have founded a number of universities (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Seventh-day_Adventist_colleges_and_universities">listed here</a>) and hospitals (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Seventh-day_Adventist_hospitals">listed here</a>) throughout the world. </p>
<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church has been active for over 100 years advocating for <strong>freedom of religion</strong>.  In 1893 its leaders founded the International Religious Liberty  Association (IRLA). They also have been formally active in humanitarian  aid for over 50 years (ADRA). </p>
<p>Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and  transgendered individuals who are, or had been, practicing Seventh-day  Adventists have formed a social network called <strong>SDA Kinship international</strong>.  SDA Kinship was the subject of a lawsuit by the Seventh-day Adventist  Church in an attempt to protect the term "SDA" from use by SDA Kinship.  The outcome of the ruling allowed the continued use of the term "SDA  Kinship". </p>

<p>The British army today has more chaplains on active service than at any time since World War II.  Thanks to a recruiting drive launched by army, navy and air force in 2005, there are about 280 chaplains in the armed forces (2007 figures).  Twelve chaplains flew out to serve the approximately 7000 British troops in Iraq.</p>

<p>No army chaplain is permitted to carry or use weapons.</p>

<p>The Royal Army Chaplains' Department is located in Upavon. The headquarters has been there since 1996. Chaplaincy training is conducted at The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre, near Andover.</p>

<p>All recruited chaplains in the British services are Christian (as of 2007), but the armed forces retain civilian chaplains to care for their Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish and Muslim recruits.</p>

<h3>A changing role</h3>

<p>The nature of the army is changing.  Soldiers no longer remain on army bases when not on active service.  A job in the armed forces is becoming closer to a regular weekday nine-to-five.  Consequently, with fewer soldiers on base at weekends, congregations at army chapels are low to nonexistent.</p>

<p>The nature of warfare has also changed drastically - including the certainty that the war's cause is just and well supported at home. Today's wars may not be about religion, but in Iraq and Afghanistan there's an element of religion in them.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that the role of army chaplains - padres - has changed as well.  Far from "building up the indomitable spirit of the army" (as Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig said in 1919), chaplains now see their role as one of support and guidance for the troops - whether or not the chaplain, or their church, believes the war is morally right.</p>

<h3>History of army chaplains</h3>
	

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>The presence of religious leaders among armies is an ancient custom. The Bible records that the Israelites brought their priests with them into battle. The Romans did as well, and had their pagan priests perform ritual sacrifices and read auguries from animal entrails on the eve of battle.
The Middle Ages produced a number of sword-bearing warrior-priests, but by the Renaissance, chaplains played chiefly a non-combatant role in the military.</p>

	<p>
	<p>When William, Duke of Normandy, invaded Britain in 1066 he had some priests on his staff. His brother, Bishop Odo of Bayeux, led his own hundred and twenty Knights into battle but because the Church objected to priests shedding blood with the sword, he used a mace as a weapon.  By the fourteenth century clergymen in the Army were fulfilling a priestly role. ...</p>
	<p>By the time of Henry VIII Chaplains had become more established and in 1621 Regimental Chaplains were mentioned in Standing Orders.  Oliver Cromwell took things a stage further so that in the New Model Army of 1645 the status of Chaplains was regularised and most Regiments had their own Chaplain ... the Articles of War of 1662 specify the duties of Chaplains.</p>

<h3>First World War</h3>
	

<p>Army chaplains came into their own during the First World War (1914-1918), with its extended periods of trench warfare and the ensuing heavy casualties.</p>

<p>Not all chaplains served at the front - some commanding officers would not allow them to risk their lives - but where they could, many chaplains did.    For men surrounded by seemingly futile death, a churchman willing to risk his life to join them in the trenches helped them make sense of the war and feel that God had not abandoned them.</p>

<p>One chaplain recounted his experiences in a letter to The Times.</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>
	<p>I can go where I like; I go to see the wounded when being brought back from the front, and to see if I am needed when gunners have been shelled.  If necessary, I am ready to go to the firing line, but I should only be in the way in the daytime.  I see the sick who come in daily and are sent off by the ambulances to a hospital down country.</p>
	<p>My first two Sundays I had no services.  My third Sunday I had one in a farmyard lasting 20 minutes; and we had to march almost directly after.  My fourth Sunday I crossed a river into the danger zone and held a service (without a surplice) for two companies, who were sleeping in bivouacs of straw in a wood in inches of water, surrounded by pools of mud up to 1ft. deep!  I then went on to another wood to some more troops, and began a service, but a deluge stopped it, and I had to cancel a third owing to rain.  We generally fight or march on Sundays!</p>

<p>In 1919 the Army Chaplains' Department became the Royal Army Chaplains' Department when King George V officially honoured its work.  By 1920 all the Protestant denominations involved had consented to be governed by the department, although the <a href="/religion/religions/christianity/catholic/">Roman Catholics</a> did not join until 2004.</p>

<p>179 British Army chaplains died in the First World War.  Three of them were awarded Victoria Cross medals.</p>

<h3>Second World War</h3>
	

<p>The role of chaplains expanded and changed during the Second World War.</p>

<p>Many things were expected of a Second World War chaplain.  For example, in the Canadian army:</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>
	<p>...in addition to celebrating mass and administering the sacraments, chaplains would visit the sick, wounded, and incarcerated, and offer religious instruction. Furthermore, chaplains were charged with strengthening regimental unity, maintaining high morale, encouraging and assisting soldiers to write to their families, censoring letters, actively participating in mess duties, and assisting medical staff in treating the wounded.</p>
	<p>Most importantly, the Department had learned during the First World War that a "jovial" chaplain visiting the front lines boosted troops' morale more than endless hours of counselling and religious guidance in the regiment's chapel. Accordingly, chaplains were encouraged to forge friendships with all military personnel and to inspire them in these times of war. In addition, chaplains were expected to maintain records of wounded and deceased military personnel and to inform the families of these tragedies, as well as to help the men relax by organizing sporting and social events.</p>
	</p>
	<p><cite>Yves Yvon J. Pelletier, Faith on the Battlefield: Canada's Catholic Chaplaincy Service during the Second World War, Historical Studies, 2003</cite></p>
	</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>

<p>The Vatican made some special wartime concessions to make life easier for military chaplains.  They were allowed to celebrate mass at times that did not interfere with soldiers' duties.  Chaplains were permitted to grant "general absolution" when they did not have time to hear individual confessions.  The required period of fasting before receiving the Eucharist was reduced from eight to four hours, and waived altogether for troops on the battlefield.  In recognition of the many difficulties involved in feeding soldiers, meat on Fridays was officially allowed.</p>

<p>96 chaplains from the British armed forces were killed in the Second World War.</p>

	Frederick Browning introduced the Padre's Hour <a href="/religion/copyright.shtml#wikimediacommons">©</a>
	</span>
	</span>
	

<h3>The Padre's Hour</h3>
	

<p>The Padre's Hour was introduced to the British army during the Second World War by The Reverend J.J.A. Hodgins on the instructions of Major General Frederick Browning.  Commanders were required to provide an hour out of training time  once a week for the padre to instruct the troops religiously.  Other armed forces, including Canada's army, copied the initiative.</p>

<p>The hour was informal ("they can smoke if they want", Time Magazine reported) and groups ideally consisted of a platoon of 20-25 soldiers rather than a larger number.  After a fifteen-minute talk by the chaplain, the rest of the time was taken up by questions from the troops.</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>The Hour is apt to be quite as instructive for the padres as for their men. Many chaplains have been joggled by such questions as: "How can you justify the Church's ownership of slum property?" Many have been startled by posers like "Why is God always represented as male?" Some 75% of the questions are social-economic, about 15% are purely religious.</p>
	<p><cite>Padre's Hour, Time Magazine, Monday 8 March 1943</cite></p>
	</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>
	<p>I recall a few anxious moments when difficult questions have come up, like... "Come on Padre, how come you are talking to us about God when we have to go out and kill?"  If anyone thinks there is an easy answer to that one - good luck.  All I could do was to help the troopie to see that the country had the right to both rule and defend itself, and that the Christian had a moral obligation to be involved in both.</p>
	<p>I would also like to say that during the whole of my association with the Battalion, I have not come across one man who claimed categorically that he is an atheist.  They might not have been Church-goers, but they accepted the fact that there was "someone up there" looking after them.</p>

<p>"The opportunity for these informal give-and-take talks has been welcomed by many of the troops," wrote Major C.P. Stacey, the historian of the Canadian Army during the Second World War, in a 1943 report.</p>

<p>There are suggestions that some commanding officers felt the Padre's Hour was not a productive use of time, or that it represented an attempt by the Church to increase its influence within the army.</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">

<p>At the moment (2007) all commissioned padres in the armed forces are Christian.  The <a href="/religion/religions/buddhism/">Buddhist</a>, <a href="/religion/religions/sikhism/">Sikh</a>, <a href="/religion/religions/hinduism/">Hindu</a> and <a href="/religion/religions/islam/">Muslim</a> soldiers in all three of the armed forces are served by Buddhist, Sikh, Hindu and Muslim Chaplains to the Military.  Mandeep Kaur (Sikh), Krishan Attri (Hindu), Asim Hafiz (Muslim) and Dr. Sunil Kariyakarawana (Buddhist) were appointed in November 2005 by John Reid, then Secretary of State for Defence.</p>

<p>Unlike Christian padres, who are commissioned officers, the four Chaplains to the Military are civilians.  At the time of their appointment there were 220 Buddhists, 90 Sikhs, 230 Hindus and 305 Muslims serving along with around 183,000 Christians.   There was already a rabbi acting as honorary chaplain to the 65 serving <a href="/religion/religions/judaism/">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>The Revd David Wilkes (a <a href="/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/methodist_1.shtml">Methodist</a>) is the Chaplain General, in charge of all army padres.  He described the difficulties involved:</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>
	<p>We've certainly had to begin to educate both the services and chaplains into their role because their role is slightly different.  They are civilians, they have a responsibility for all personnel, army, navy and air force, so they have a mammoth task before them, and quite often they are not seen as much on the ground as a unit chaplain would be.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, they're very proactive and get about and communicate with their people because their role is to look after the specific spiritual needs of their own community.</p>
	</p>
	<p><cite>The Revd David Wilkes, Chaplain General</cite></p>
	</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>

<p>Wilkes believes the army will eventually have full-time, commissioned non-Christian chaplains.</p>

<p>The armed forces are moving towards better provision for all religious dietary requirements, including kosher and halal meat.</p>

<p>As well as ministering to individual soldiers, the chaplains act as advisors and educate the armed forces about their respective faiths.  It is also their job to conduct services when a soldier is killed.</p>

<p>Muslim soldiers are given room to <a href="/religion/religions/islam/practices/salat.shtml">pray</a> five times a day and are allowed to fast during <a href="/religion/religions/islam/practices/sawm.shtml">Ramadan</a> as long as it does not interfere with military duties, although some Muslim soldiers have said they were made to feel that it would be more convenient if they didn't pray.</p>

<h3>War in the Muslim world</h3>
	

<p>The Iraq war was already in full swing when the four multifaith chaplains were appointed in 2005.  Imam Hafiz talked about his reaction to the fact that his troops were fighting in Muslim countries:</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>As a chaplain I don't see the military's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan to be an opportunity or a problem.  You know, I'm the chaplain and I've been appointed to do a specific job, and that job is to provide spiritual and religious support to the Muslim military personnel.  From the Islamic perspective it's not good to use violence or bear arms against anyone, regardless of their faith, and no life should be killed unjustifiably.</p>

<p>To join the British army, chaplains must be British or from a Commonwealth nation or the Republic of Ireland, in which case they must be sponsored by a British church.</p>

<p>Chaplains receive a three-year commission that can later be extended to five years.  After that term is at an end, what happens next depends on the age of the chaplain.  The average age of recruited chaplains is 38.</p>

<p>The padres do their own specialist training.  Like officers, they are sent to the Sandhurst military academy.  Their course is four weeks long instead of a year and is informally known as the 'vicars and tarts' course.  It's also for doctors, dentists, lawyers and veterinarians.  Padres have to get fit and receive basic grounding in military procedures.  They are not taught how to fire a weapon.</p>

<p>They have their own specialist lectures from the senior chaplain, including how to persuade 70 or 80 recalcitrant soldiers to sing!</p>

<p>In the U.S. armed forces, chaplains must have a master's degree in divinity and two years' experience in a church (or mosque or synagogue).  They are taught all the same skills as soldiers, except how to use a weapon.</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>
	<p>There is intense preparation for counseling, and learning how to minister to soldiers who are not part of the chaplain's own religious tradition. And then there is the matter of learning how to prepare soldiers spiritually for death -- and for the task of killing others.</p>
	<p>To many clergy outside the military, an ordained minister helping a man get comfortable with taking another man's life is a betrayal of the clerical mission. Military chaplains, however, understand that in a fallen and imperfect world, war (to quote Gen. Colin Powell) should be a last resort, but it should be a resort. ("If we're not going to war with a tear in our eyes and our hearts broken, we aren't coming at it from the right place," one chaplain told me.) This is what they tell the troops.</p>
	<p>They also give them a theological grounding in just-war theory, which attempts to set out conditions under which violence, even killing, is the morally responsible thing to do.</p>

<p>Chaplains hold a unique place in the army.  They wear the army uniform but, although employed and paid by the Ministry of Defence, they are sent by their churches and their churches retain spiritual authority over them.  If this authority is revoked the chaplain must leave the army.</p>

<p>Padres do not think of themselves as army officers at all: they are clergy, first and foremost, who happen to work in the military.  At the end of their chain of command is God.</p>

<p>Army chaplains believe that they are following the 'incarnational' principle: following the example of Jesus, they live alongside their charges and share their life.</p>

<p>A chaplain needs to know the rules and also have a wider moral view.  Sometimes this may mean adapting the Church's rules in practice.</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>We tend to sit very lightly on the church's rules about things like communion.  If somebody comes to communion they get communion and I encourage them to come.  We'll deal with the legalities later.</p>
	<p><cite>Andrew Martlew, chaplain to 40 Regiment Royal Artillery</cite></p>
	</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>

<p>Padres are allowed to raise moral questions.  If they have doubts about specific plans, they will discuss them with the commanding officer.  The Revd David Wilkes, Chaplain General, calls the army padre "the friend of the soldier and the <em>critical</em> friend of the C.O."</p>

	
	<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
	<blockquote>
	<p>I think part of his job is taking the temperature of morale and being able to guide the chain of command to apply greater welfare... arguably more so than the conventional chain of command who don't have quite that time or thought to be able to do that.</p>

	</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>

<p>This is not to say chaplains are allowed to be subversive or encourage soldiers to disobey orders.  Not only is this far outside their duty, but it could put lives in danger - not to mention careers.</p>

<p>Like a soldier, if a chaplain felt that they could not remain in uniform on conscience grounds, they have the option to resign.  Most choose to stay, not least because of the drive to minister to soldiers in the same situation.</p>

<p>Padres are not there to justify the conflicts that the army is in.  Their purpose is "to walk with the men and to help them", to be there for people who need them and to be, as one padre put it, "a bit like Jiminy Cricket... the little voice of conscience".</p>

	<p>When you talk to military chaplains about why they chose this relatively rare vocation, you inevitably find a special love for soldiers, sailors, and military life, as well as a missionary hunger to be a witness for God in extreme life-or-death situations.</p>
	<p>You will also often hear Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German evangelical pastor martyred by the Nazis after they learned of his role in a failed plot to assassinate Hitler, invoked as a role model. "He rejected a comfortable appointment in America to go back to Germany during the Nazi persecutions," says Army chaplain Timothy Mallard. "He said he'd have no moral right to stand with his people after the war if he didn't stand with them now. I feel that way too."</p>

<p>Padres themselves are non-combatants but they must work with soldiers, some of whom may be questioning their role in the conflict.  What advice can they give?</p>

<h3>God and the Gun</h3>
	

<span class="image_with_caption float_right" style="width: 130px;">
	<img alt="Presenter Martin Bell stands in front of a tank, wearing a bulletproof vest with the word PRESS on it" height="180" src="/religion/religions/christianity/priests/images/armymartinbell.jpg" width="130"/><span class="caption" style="width: 120px;">
	Martin Bell in Basra, Iraq 
	</span>
	</span>
	

<p>This two-part radio series was broadcast on Mondays 12th and 19th March, 2007, on Radio 4.  It was presented by Martin Bell, himself a former soldier, and was the culmination of more than a year's time spent with army chaplains during training, while stationed at military bases and on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Most of the audio clips used throughout this article are from the series.  Below, you can listen to the programmes in full.</p>

<p>God and the Gun won the Premier Award at the 2007 Sandford St Martin Trust Religious Radio Awards.</p>

<h3>God and the Gun - programme 1</h3>
	

<p>2006 was a watershed year for the armed forces chaplaincy; it was the year it turned from an exclusively Christian service to a multifaith one.</p>

<p>With more and more recruits joining the army, navy and RAF from ethnic minority communities, the chaplaincy had to change with the times and a Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist and Hindu were appointed to serve those growing spiritual needs.</p>

<p>What does it take to become a chaplain in the army? How have the new multifaith chaplains coped with their new high-profile role?</p>

<h3>God and the Gun - programme 2</h3>
	

<p>Fr. William Cummings, a padre serving with the US Marines in the Pacific during the Second World War, is often credited with the saying "there are no atheists in foxholes."</p>

<p>The maxim may have grown hackneyed over years, but when soldiers go off to war zones their thoughts understandably turn to what might happen if things go wrong. This is when army chaplains can step in to bring help and comfort.</p>

<p>Martin Bell travels to Basra in Iraq to meet The Reverend Andrew Martlew, chaplain to 40 Regiment Royal Artillery.</p>

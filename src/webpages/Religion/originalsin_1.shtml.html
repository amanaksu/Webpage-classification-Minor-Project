									<h2 class="heading-nth-1" id="h1">What is original sin?</h2>
									<p>Original sin is an Augustine Christian doctrine that says
										that everyone is born sinful. This means that they are born
										with a built-in urge to do bad things and to disobey God. It
										is an important doctrine within the Roman Catholic Church.
										The concept of Original Sin was explained in depth by St
										Augustine and formalised as part of Roman Catholic doctrine
										by the Councils of Trent in the 16th Century. </p>
									<p>Original sin is not just this inherited spiritual disease or
										defect in human nature; it's also the 'condemnation' that
										goes with that fault.</p>
									<h3>An explanation for the evils of the world</h3>
									<p>Some Christians believe that original sin explains why there
										is so much wrong in a world created by a perfect God, and
										why people need to have their souls 'saved' by God.</p>
									<h3>A condition you're in, not something you do</h3>
									<p>Original sin is a condition, not something that people do:
										It's the normal spiritual and psychological condition of
										human beings, not their bad thoughts and actions. Even a
										newborn baby who hasn't done anything at all is damaged by
										original sin.</p>
									<h3>The sin of Adam</h3>
									<p>In traditional Christian teaching, original sin is the result
										of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God when they ate a
										forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.</p>
									<h3>Effects of original sin</h3>
									<p>Original sin affects individuals by separating them from God,
										and bringing dissatisfaction and guilt into their lives.</p>
									<p>On a world scale, original sin explains such things as
										genocide, <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/war.shtml"
											>war</a>, cruelty, exploitation and abuse, and the
										"presence and universality of sin in human history".</p>
									<h3>How to cure original sin</h3>
									<p>Some Christians believe that human beings can't cure
										themselves of original sin. The only way they can be saved
										from its consequences is by the grace of God.</p>
									<p>The only way people can receive God's grace is by accepting
										his love and forgiveness, believing that <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/history/jesus_1.shtml"
											>Jesus Christ</a>  <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/history/passionofchrist_1.shtml"
											>died on the cross</a> to redeem their sins, and getting
										baptised.</p>
									<h3>Secular ideas of original sin</h3>
									<p>Modern thinkers don't think the doctrine of original sin is
										literally true, but they do think it contains real truths
										about the human condition:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The world is not as good as we want it to be</li>
										<li>We are not as good as we want to be</li>
										<li>Individual behaviour is greatly influenced by things
											outside the individual's control</li>
										<li>Many of these are historical things: <ul>
												<li>events in the individual's past</li>
												<li>events in the past of the individual's
												family</li>
												<li>customs that their culture has built up through
												history</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>These things affect humanity as a group as well as
											individuals</li>
									</ul>

									<h2 id="h2">Christianity and the fall</h2>
									<p>Original sin is part of the <em>Doctrine of the Fall</em>,
										which is the belief that when Adam and Eve disobeyed God,
										they 'fell' from perfection and brought evil into a perfect
										world.</p>
									<h3>Fall goes with redemption</h3>
									<p>For Christians, the fall is inseparable from <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/whydidjesusdie_1.shtml"
											>redemption</a> - the act by which human souls are
										washed clean of the stain of original sin.</p>
									<h3>A tale of two Adams</h3>
									<p>Christians believe that the story of the fall and redemption
										is a story of two Adams, and sometimes refer to Christ as
										the "Second Adam".</p>
									<p>The first Adam sins and causes humanity to fall; the second
										Adam atones for that sin with his death and redeems
										humanity.</p>
									<h3>The traditional story of original sin</h3>
									<p>The story behind original sin is told in the <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/texts/bible.shtml"
											>Old Testament</a> book of Genesis:</p>
									<p>God originally made a perfect world. He created Adam and put
										him to live in the Garden of Eden - a blissful place where
										he had nothing to do but take care of the garden.</p>
									<span class="image_with_caption float_right"
										style="width: 200px;">
										<img alt="Tiger rattlesnake" height="120"
											src="/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/images/snake2.jpg"
											width="200" /><span class="caption"
											style="width: 190px;"> Serpent </span>
									</span>
									<p>God told Adam that he could do anything he wanted, except eat
										the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
									<p>Later, God created Eve to be Adam's wife. Eve was tricked by
										the serpent into eating the fruit of the tree of the
										knowledge of life and death. She gave some of the fruit to
										Adam and he ate it too.</p>
									<p>Adam and Eve realised that they were naked and hid in shame.
										When God next visited the Garden he realised that they had
										disobeyed him.</p>
									<p>God banished them from the Garden of Eden into the harsh
										world outside.</p>
									<p>God also banned them from eating the fruit of the tree of
										life, and so death entered the world.</p>
									<h3>The Fall and the origin of evil</h3>
									<p>Christians believe that when Adam and Eve sinned in Eden and
										turned away from God they brought sin into the world and
										turned the whole human race away from God.</p>
									<p>The doctrine absolves God of responsibility for the evils
										that make our world imperfect by teaching that Adam and Eve
										introduced evil to a perfect world when they disobeyed
										him.</p>
									<p>An alternative understanding of the story of the fall
										emphasises that Adam and Eve did wrong because they 'gave
										in' to the temptation of the serpent in the Garden of
										Eden.</p>
									<p>These two versions offer radically different ideas about the
										origin of evil:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>in the first version Adam and Eve bring evil into the
											world by disobeying God</li>
										<li>in the second version evil already exists, and Adam and
											Eve bring sin to humanity by giving in to it</li>
									</ul>
									<p>This second understanding fits well with human psychology.
										Looking at it this way, original sin becomes the tendency
										for human beings to 'give in' when tempted by the prevailing
										evils of the society around them, rather than standing up
										for good, and it helps explain why each individual finds
										temptation so hard to resist. As the Bible puts it:</p>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>... I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing
												I hate...</p>
											<p><cite>Romans 7:14-15</cite></p>
										</blockquote>
									</div>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>
									<p>A third understanding teaches not so much that Adam's sin
										brought sin into the world, but that it removed from
										humanity the gift that enabled people to be perfectly
										obedient to God.</p>
									<h3>A modern interpretation</h3>
									<p>A modern interpretation of the fall might go like this:</p>
									<p>Adam was created in the image of God with the potential to be
										perfectly fulfilled through his existence and his
										relationship with God.</p>
									<p>But Man failed to fulfil his potential and opted to go it
										alone and estrange himself from God.</p>
									<p>Jesus as the "Second Adam" re-established the relationship
										with God and showed how man can become perfectly human -
										which puts him in right relationship with both the creator
										and his creation.</p>
									<h3>Usefulness of the doctrine</h3>
									<p>Original sin is a difficult doctrine, and a rather gloomy
										one, but it had some key theological benefits that have kept
										it as a mainstream Christian teaching:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Universality: Original sin teaches that all human beings
											are flawed and sinful - no-one is better than anyone
											else</li>
										<li>Non-dualist: Original sin explains evil without having
											to portray God as having a bad side, or an evil partner,
											responsible for the badness in the world; evil comes
											from human rebelliousness</li>
										<li>Non-designed: Original sin explains how a world that God
											designed to be perfect is actually full of evil</li>
										<li>Not inevitable: Original sin teaches that the world
											could have remained perfect - it was not inevitable that
											Adam and Eve would disobey God</li>
										<li>Mechanism: Original sin demonstrates a mechanism that
											enabled the original disobedience to damage
											everyone</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>The Fall and Christian Europe</h3>
									<p>What effect has the concept of original sin had on Western
										culture, and how did it influence gender and morality in
										Christian Europe?</p>
									<p>Discussing the question are Martin Palmer, theologian and
										Director of the International Consultancy on Religion,
										Education and Culture; Griselda Pollock, Professor of Art
										History at the University of Leeds; and John Carey, Emeritus
										Professor of English Literature at Oxford University.</p>

									<h2 id="h3">Transmission of original sin</h2>
									<p>How does original sin get from Adam to 21st century human
										beings?</p>
									<p>One rather difficult explanation says that the whole human
										race was somehow contained in Adam and so when Adam fell,
										they fell too.</p>
									<p>The other explanation, expanded below, is that all human
										beings are descendants of Adam and Eve.</p>
									<p>Modern Catholic teaching is less clear about the mechanism of
										transmission and refers to it as a mystery.</p>
									<h3>St Augustine's theory</h3>
									<p>St Augustine, who largely devised the theory of original sin,
										thought that original sin was transmitted from generation to
										generation through sexual intercourse. Augustine did not say
										exactly how this happened.</p>
									<p>He said that it was transmitted by "concupiscence", when
										people had sex and conceived a child.</p>
									<p>Concupiscence is a technical theological word that Augustine
										used to refer to sexual desire as something bad in the soul
										that was inseparable from normal human sexual impulses.</p>
									<p>Sexual desire was bad, he taught, because it could totally
										overwhelm those caught up in it, depriving them of
										self-control and rational thought. This disapproving view of
										passion was quite common among Christians of Augustine's
										time.</p>
									<p>Augustine thought that concupiscence was present in all
										sexual intercourse. He thought that it was just as bad and
										uncontrolled in a marriage as it was in non-marital sex, but
										that an excuse could be made for it within marriage because
										its purpose was to produce legitimate children.</p>
									<p>This bad element in sex provides the means by which original
										sin is transmitted from father to child. It transmits both
										humanity's guilt for Adam's crime and the sickness or defect
										that gives human beings a sinful nature.</p>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>
												<p>...whenever it comes to the actual process of
												generation, the very embrace which is lawful and
												honourable cannot be effected without the ardour
												of lust....</p>
												<p>[This lust] is the daughter of sin, as it were;
												and whenever it yields assent to the commission of
												shameful deeds, it becomes also the mother of many
												sins.</p>
												<p>Now from this concupiscence whatever comes into
												being by natural birth is bound by original
												sin...</p>
											</p>
											<p><cite>Augustine, De bono coniugali</cite></p>

									<h3>The Council of Trent</h3>
									<p>The Council or Trent (1545-63), or Trentine councils were a
										series of Roman Catholic theological meetings in response to
										the Reformation. </p>
									<p>The Council of Trent gave the official stamp to the idea that
										original sin was transferred from generation to generation
										by propagation - which means during the sexual act that led
										to conception. This formalised the notion of Original Sin as
										part of Roman Catholic doctrine.</p>
									<p>The Council explicitly ruled out the idea that original sin
										was transferred by "imitation"; in order to block the idea
										that human beings just copied the bad example set by their
										parents and others.</p>
									<h3>Imitation and mimesis</h3>
									<p>These closely related ideas teach that original sin is passed
										on by copying the sinful tendencies of other people. The
										Council of Trent decreed that this idea was false.</p>

									<h2 id="h4">Getting rid of original sin</h2>
									<p>The only way a person can 'cleanse' their soul from sin is
										to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>accept that Christ's <a
												href="/religion/religions/christianity/history/passionofchrist_1.shtml"
												>death on the cross</a> atoned for this sin</li>
										<li>accept that only God's grace can cure this sin</li>
										<li>confess their sins and ask for forgiveness</li>
										<li>be baptised</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Many churches accept that infants can be cleansed of original
										sin by being baptised soon after birth. The other elements
										required are carried out by adults on the baby's behalf
										during the ceremony.</p>
									<h3>Redemption</h3>
									<p>In St Paul's letter to the Galatians, he wrote: "Christ has
										set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not submit again
										to a yoke of slavery". This conception of Redemption as
										freedom from bondage is crucial for Judeo-Christian
										thought.</p>
									<p>Three academics - Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford; Janet
										Soskice, Reader in Modern Theology and Philosophical
										Theology at Cambridge University; and Stephen Mulhall,
										Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy at Oxford University -
										discuss the idea of transformation from fallenness to
										salvation.</p>

									<h2 id="h5">Problems with original sin</h2>
									<h3>The unanswered question</h3>
									<p>On the face of it, original sin doesn't answer the question
										as to how evil got into the world; instead it leaves other
										questions to be answered. As one writer puts it:</p>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>Why is there original sin? Because Adam sinned? Then
												why did Adam sin? If it was because of the serpent,
												why did the serpent sin? If the serpent is supposed
												to have been a fallen angel, why did the angel sin?
												And so on.</p>
										</blockquote>
									</div>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>
									<span class="image_with_caption float_right"
										style="width: 200px;">
										<img alt="Tiger rattlesnake" height="120"
											src="/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/images/snake1.jpg"
											width="200" /><span class="caption"
											style="width: 190px;"> Serpent </span>
									</span>
									<p>And there is a second, but related, question. If evil did not
										exist before Adam sinned, how could Adam know that what he
										was about to do was evil - how was he to know that it was
										wrong to disobey God?</p>
									<h3>It's unfair</h3>
									<p>For modern people the idea of being punished for a crime
										committed by someone else is unethical and unacceptable.</p>
									<p>Original sin belongs to each of us because it belongs to
										all.</p>
									<h3>It's misogynistic</h3>
									<p>The doctrine of original sin blames Eve for tempting Adam
										into sin and has been responsible for centuries of Christian
										bias against women.</p>
									<h3>It's anti-sex</h3>
									<p>Augustine's theory of original sin was so intrinsically tied
										up with his disapproval of human sexual love that for
										centuries it contaminated all sexual passion with the idea
										of sin.</p>
									<h3>It's too pessimistic</h3>
									<p>Some Christian thinkers are unhappy with the idea that human
										beings start out so bad that they can't become good without
										God's help.</p>
									<h3>It's not literally true</h3>
									<p>Science shows that the Biblical creation story is not
										literally true, and demonstrates that Adam and Eve and the
										Garden of Eden are myths and not historical figures.</p>
									<p>This destroys the idea of original sin as being caused by the
										misbehaviour of the first man and woman, and the idea of
										inheriting guilt or punishment for that misbehaviour.</p>
									<p>Most modern theologians don't think this a good reason to
										abandon the doctrine of the fall. They believe that although
										the story is not historically true, it does contain
										important truths about the state of humanity.</p>
									<h3>It's contradicted by evolution</h3>
									<p>The doctrine of original sin is based on the idea that God
										created a perfect world, and that humanity damaged it and
										themselves by disobeying him.</p>
									<p>Evolution, on the other hand, suggests that life in the world
										is steadily changing and becoming more diverse. Scientists
										do not tend to think of this as a moral good or evil, but in
										a sense evolution sees life on earth as moving closer to
										'perfection' - becoming better adapted to its
										environment.</p>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>The biblical story of the perfect and finished
												creation from which human beings fell into sin is
												pre-Darwinian mythology and post-Darwinian
												nonsense.</p>
											<p><cite>Bishop John Shelby Spong, A Call for a New
												Reformation, 1998</cite></p>
										</blockquote>
									</div>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>
									<p>A more modern idea is to give an ethical spin to the
										evolutionary idea and suggest that humanity should not be
										concerned about a past fall from grace, but concentrate on
										becoming more ethical beings and thus bringing about a
										better world.</p>
									<h3>What about unbaptised babies?</h3>
									<p>Bishop Richard Holloway has described the idea that
										unbaptised babies go to hell as "one of the most
										unsympathetic of the Christian doctrines," and not greatly
										improved by the teaching that there is a special "limbo" for
										unbaptised babies on the outskirts of the inferno.</p>
									<p>This is covered later in this article.</p>
									<h3>Is guilt good?</h3>
									<p>Original sin has been criticised for inspiring excessive
										feelings of guilt. The 18th-century politician and
										philosopher Edmund Burke once said: "Guilt was never a
										rational thing; it distorts all the faculties of the human
										mind, it perverts them, it leaves a man no longer in the
										free use of his reason, it puts him into confusion."</p>
									<p>Is the feeling of guilt a vital part of our moral lives or
										can it do more harm than good? Discussing the question are
										Stephen Mulhall, Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy at New
										College, Oxford; Miranda Fricker, Senior Lecturer in
										Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London; and Oliver
										Davies, Professor of Christian Doctrine at King's College
										London.</p>

									<h2 id="h6">Unbaptised babies</h2>
									<h3>The concept of 'Limbo'</h3>
									<p>One of the biggest problems the <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/catholic/"
											>Catholic Church</a> faced over the years was the
										problem of children who died before they were baptised.</p>
									<p>Before the 13th Century, all unbaptised people, including new
										born babies who died, would go to Hell, according to the
										Catholic Church. This was because original sin had not been
										cleansed by baptism. This idea however was criticised by
										Peter Abelard, a French scholastic philosophiser, who said
										that babies who had no personal sin didn't even deserve
										punishment.</p>
									<p>It was Abelard who introduced the idea of 'Limbo'. The word
										comes from the Latin 'limbus', meaning the edge. This would
										be a state of existence where unbaptised babies, and those
										unfortunate enough to have been born before Jesus, would not
										experience pain but neither would they experience the
										Beatific Vision of God.</p>
									<p>Abelard's idea was accepted in the 13th century by <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/pope/">Pope</a>
										Innocent III, the most powerful Pope in Roman Catholic
										history. The idea of Limbo was defined in 1904 by Pope Pius
										X in his catechism.</p>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>Babies dead without baptism go to Limbo, where they
												do not enjoy God, but neither do they suffer,
												because, having Original Sin alone, they do not
												deserve Paradise, but neither do they merit Hell or
												Purgatory.</p>
											<p><cite>Pope Pius X</cite></p>
										</blockquote>
									</div>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>
									<p>However, unease remained over reconciling a Loving God with
										one who sent babies to Limbo and the church still faced much
										criticism.</p>
									<p>The Church, which has never claimed to definitely know who
										will go to Heaven apart from the <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/saints/"
											>Saints</a>, or Hell, has said that the issue has long
										been one of speculation in the Church. This speculation has
										led to an oversimplification of the matter, and some people
										have regarded it as fact when it was never the case.</p>
									<p>Catholics are only sure of the following two pieces of
										information in this matter:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>that God is merciful</li>
										<li>that baptism is necessary for salvation</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Catholics feel sure that God won't impose punishment on
										babies who are free from personal guilt, but they do admit
										they don't know what their afterlife will hold.</p>
									<h3>State of Limbo revised</h3>
									<p>In 1992, Pope <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/pope/johnpaulii_1.shtml"
											>John Paul II</a> had Limbo removed from the catechism
										and both Pope John Paul and Pope <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/pope/benedictxvi_1.shtml"
											>Benedict XVI</a> urged further study on the concept. In
										April 2007 Pope Benedict XVI approved the findings of a
										report by the International Theological Commission, a
										Vatican advisory body, which found grounds that the souls of
										unbaptised children would go to heaven, thus revising
										traditional teaching on Limbo.</p>
									<p>The report said there were "reasons to hope that infants who
										die without baptism may be saved and brought into eternal
										happiness".</p>
									<p>Parents were urged to continue to baptise their children, as
										the Vatican stressed that baptism is still considered
										necessary to achieve salvation; the report emphasised that
										"there are reasons to hope that God will save these infants
										precisely because it was not possible" to baptise them.</p>

									<h2 id="h7">St Augustine and original sin</h2>
									<p>St Augustine was Bishop of Hippo, in what is now Algeria,
										from 396 to 430. He was one of the greatest theologians in
										history and his ideas still influence Christian thought
										today.</p>
									<p>Although he didn't invent the doctrine of original sin, his
										ideas about it dominated Western Church teaching.</p>
									<p>Augustine's theory shows great understanding of human
										psychology. It provides an explanation for human suffering
										and guilt by teaching that those human beings somehow
										deserved these things.</p>
									<p>Human beings deserve to suffer because the first parents
										sinned. And since humanity deserves the bad things it gets,
										humanity can comfort itself with the idea that it has a just
										rather than an unjust God.</p>
									<p>This made the presence of evil in the world easier to
										understand, and answered the question of why a benevolent
										God would allow such a state of affairs to exist.</p>
									<h3>Purpose of the theory</h3>
									<p>Augustine developed his idea of original sin for several
										reasons:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>to explain the almost irresistible pressure to behave
											badly that troubles even the most saintly people</li>
										<li>to justify the need to baptise babies as soon as
											possible after birth</li>
										<li>to demonstrate that human beings are totally reliant on
											God's grace and all-powerful goodness</li>
										<li>to defeat the ideas of Pelagius, an English
											theologian</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Augustine's theory</h3>
									<p>Augustine saw original sin as working in two ways:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>inherited guilt for a crime</li>
										<li>spiritual sickness or weakness</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Augustine thought that humanity was originally perfect
										("man's nature was created at first faultless and without
										any sin"), immortal and blessed with many talents, but that
										Adam and Eve disobeyed God, and introduced sin and death to
										the world.</p>
									<p>Augustine didn't see any need to provide a good reason why
										Adam, who had originally been created perfect, chose to sin,
										or why God hadn't created a perfect being that was incapable
										of sin.</p>
									<p>As far as Augustine was concerned the point was that Adam had
										sinned and humanity had to deal with the consequences.</p>
									<p>Modern people would think it unjust that human beings should
										suffer for something that happened long before they existed,
										but to people in Augustine's time the idea of punishing
										later generations for their parents' crimes was
										familiar.</p>
									<h3>Why Adam's sin affects everyone</h3>
									<p>Augustine developed the following argument:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>the whole essence of human nature was contained in Adam,
											the first man</li>
										<li>when Adam disobeyed God, the whole of human nature
											disobeyed God</li>
										<li>thus the whole of human nature became sinful</li>
										<li>thus the whole human race was damaged for all time.</li>
									</ul>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>Nothing remains but to conclude that in the first man
												all are understood to have sinned, because all were
												in him when he sinned; whereby sin is brought in
												with birth and not removed save by the new birth...
												it is manifest that in Adam all sinned, so to speak,
												en masse. By that sin we became a corrupt mass.</p>
											<p><cite>Augustine</cite></p>
										</blockquote>
									</div>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>
									<p>Bible scholars think that this element of Augustine's theory
										was partly based on a mistranslation in the Latin version of
										the Bible. However, Augustine does not base his entire
										argument only on that particular text, and his theory is not
										wrecked by this error.</p>
									<p>Having established that every human being had inherited guilt
										from Adam, Augustine taught that this was why that all human
										beings were damned, even if they didn't commit any extra
										sins of their own.</p>
									<h3>Consequence of original sin</h3>
									<p>Augustine was certain that the consequence of original sin
										was damnation. This even applied to people who hadn't
										committed any sins, like newborn babies, if they died before
										their souls were cleaned by baptism.</p>
									<p>People could only escape damnation through God's grace, and
										the sacrifice of <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/history/jesus_1.shtml"
											>Jesus</a> on the Cross for their sins. God's grace was
										passed on through baptism (or martyrdom - but this was a
										route that few would choose).</p>
									<p>Unfortunately there was no guarantee that everyone who was
										baptised would be saved from damnation, merely the certainty
										that those who weren't baptised would go to hell.</p>

									<h2 id="h8">Churches' teachings about original sin</h2>
									<h3>Protestant teaching - Calvin</h3>
									<p>The Protestant theologian John Calvin (1509-1564) believed
										that humanity's unbelief and disobedience had so
										fundamentally changed the human race that little, if
										anything, of God was left in it.</p>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>We are lost, there is no means of help; and whether
												we are great or small, fathers or children, we are
												all without exception in a state of damnation if God
												does not remove from us the curse which weighs upon
												us, and that by His generosity and grace, without
												His being obliged to do so.</p>
											<p><cite>John Calvin</cite></p>
										</blockquote>
									</div>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_bottom"> </div>
									<h3>Protestant - modern</h3>
									<p>Many modern Protestants would not take quite such a gloomy
										view of humanity as Calvin, and would not regard humankind
										as evil in essence, without any trace of the divine
										image.</p>
									<p>They would still teach that human beings are 'fallen' and
										need to 'get right with God', by believing that <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/history/jesus_1.shtml"
											>Christ</a>'s death 'atoned' for their sin, accepting
										that they can only be 'saved' by God's freely given 'grace',
										and being baptised.</p>
									<h3>Orthodox teaching</h3>
									<p>The Christian <a
											href="/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/easternorthodox_1.shtml"
											>Orthodox churches</a> don't interpret original sin in
										the way that Augustine did. They don't accept that people
										can be guilty of a sin they did not commit, and so reject
										the idea of inherited guilt passed down the generations.</p>
									<p>The Orthodox interpretation of original sin is that the way
										in which human beings inherit sinfulness is that human
										history, culture and society have created a moral climate
										which disposes human beings to behave sinfully; as a result,
										all people need God's help to avoid sin.</p>
									<h3>Roman Catholic teaching</h3>
									<p>The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church was summarised by
										Pope Paul VI:</p>
									<div class="promo_quote_box_top">
										<blockquote>
											<p>
												<p>We believe that in Adam all have sinned, which
												means that the original offence committed by him
												caused human nature, common to all men, to fall to
												a state in which it bears the consequences of that
												offence, and which is not the state in which it
												was at first in our first parents, established as
												they were in holiness and justice, and in which
												man knew neither evil nor death.</p>
												<p>It is human nature so fallen, stripped of the
												grace that clothed it, injured in its own natural
												powers and subjected to the dominion of death,
												that is transmitted to all men, and it is in this
												sense that every man is born in sin.</p>
												<p>We therefore hold, with the Council of Trent,
												that original sin is transmitted with human nature
												'not by imitation, but by propagation' and that it
												is thus 'proper to everyone.'</p>
												<p>We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ, by the
												sacrifice of the cross, redeemed us from original
												sin and all the personal sins committed by each
												one of us, so that, in accordance with the word of
												the Apostle, 'where sin abounded, grace did more
												abound.'</p>
											</p>
											<p><cite>Paul VI 1968</cite></p>

                  Martha and the Vandellas), and a gripping romantic
                  story as well as a heartfelt story of blacks oppressed
                  by segregation in the south. It uses the stirrings of
                  the civil rights movement in the background to show
                  that without activists the evils of racial
                  discrimination might never have ended. The American
                  classic drama, one of the more genuine and meaningful

                  whirlwind romance despite her father's objections that
                  he's not a church-goer and is a rabble-rouser who
                  won't fit into this conservative small town. Weary of
                  life on the railroad, where travel is mandatory, Duff
                  trades his relatively well-paying job for a low-paying
                  laborer job at the local sawmill. But trouble looms
                  when he tells the blacks their best chance of survival
                  is sticking together and joining a union. When the
                  racist white boss demands Duff act servile to the
                  whites, as is the accepted custom in the south, and
                  recant what he said to the black mill workers and he
                  refuses, he's immediately fired. Feeling that he's not
                  a good enough man because he's unable to support his
                  pregnant wife, Duff visits </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Birmingham to see his
                  illegitimate son and finds the kid has been abandoned
                  by his mom and is reluctantly cared for by a needy
                  stranger--who is promised support from dad. Even more
                  brutal for Duff is a visit to his ill-tempered,
                  alcoholic and sick one-armed father (</span><b>Julius
                  Harris</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">), who is
                  looked after by a lonely woman (</span><b>Gloria
                  Foster</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">). The
                  father, who deserted his family, picks a fight with
                  his son and throws him out of his house. The miserable
                  Duff takes his troubles out on his sweet supportive
                  wife and strikes the pregnant woman when he's fired
                  from a gas station job, obtained for him by her
                  father, when white racists demand the white owner fire

                  accustomed Jim Crow treatment of blacks or else the

                  style="font-weight: bold;">The quality film has two
                  liberal white filmmakers in a memorable way capturing
                  the black experience and making such a downbeat story
                  uplifting. It wasn't until a few years later that more
                  blacks started directing and black pride became a
                  movement sweeping across the country, whereby the
                  blacks gave voice to their own experiences like never
                  before in Hollywood. The timeless dramatic film, which
                  also serves as a valuable history lesson, allows us to
                  look at ourselves now with proper reflection and how
                  it was back then, as it proclaims in its humanitarian
                  cry for equality the urgency for people to live with
                  dignity and respect for each other.<br>

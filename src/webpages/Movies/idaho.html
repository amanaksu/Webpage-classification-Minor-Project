                  the ranch and confront the judge that he's the
                  notorious gentleman bank robber Tom Allison. Which
                  turns out true, as the judge is an ex-convict whose
                  real name is Allison and served time some 22 years ago
                  and paid his debt to society. The thugs give their
                  former colleague a beating after he refuses to hide
                  them and escape by car. But are pursued by the rangers
                  on horse. The thugs are given a lift to Belle Bonner's
                  (Ona Munson) casino by passing motorist Frog Millhouse
                  (</b><b>Smiley Burnette)</b><b>, a ranch-hand of
                  Grey's, when their car stalls because Roy hit the gas
                  tank. Belle welcomes the gangsters and hides them in
                  her shack in the hills, and uses the info they provide
                  to blackmail the judge into stopping the town council
                  from closing her gambling and prostitute place in
                  exchange for keeping his secret from the town. The
                  judge refuses. Thereby the two visiting thugs hold-up
                  the bank and kill a bystander. The incident is blamed
                  on Allison, and when the judge's past is revealed it's
                  up to Roy to straighten things out. When he does, he
                  wins the girl of his dreams.<br>

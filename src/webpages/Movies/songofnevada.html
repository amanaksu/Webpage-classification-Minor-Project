                  life for the virtues of the bean-eaters of rural

                  plane makes an emergency stop for repairs in Lomitas,
                  Nevada. There Barrabee meets singing cowboy Roy Rogers
                  and the Sons of the Pioneer, as they sing around a
                  campfire. Having a good time with Roy, </span><span

                  while out horse back riding and decides to go along
                  with Roy on his cattle drive. At the end of the cattle
                  drive they read in the newspaper that the plane
                  crashed into a dam and </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Barrabee was reported as
                  dead. They also read that Jenny plans on selling the
                  Mesa County ranch and then marrying Rollo, and are at
                  the ranch now. Barrabee cooks up a scheme to stop the
                  ranch sale and marriage, as he hires Roy </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;"> to drive the Barrabee
                  entry in the annual Frontier Days stagecoach race and
                  gives him a written contract signed before his death.
                  The loyal Jenny is forced to honor it. When Roy wins,
                  Jenny's godfather and friendly neighbor rancher, </span><span

                (<b>Forrest Taylor</b>), <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">is irate because he loses when a tampered axle
                  bolt causes the stagecoach to go off the road. The
                  colonel accuses Roy of sabotage after he finds the pin
                  in his coat pocket. The crooked foreman, Ferguson

                  learns Jenny is broke. But when Roy shows up to tell
                  Jenny the truth, Rollo overhears it and returns. He
                  then sends Ferguson to the fishing shack. After a
                  squabble with the now alive ranch owner over cattle
                  stolen by the foreman and sold by him for his personal

                  caused the stagecoach breakdown and the sheriff also
                  arrests Rollo for his part in that crime. It ends on a
                  happy note, with Jenny falling in love with Roy and
                  realizing it's home on the range for her from now on

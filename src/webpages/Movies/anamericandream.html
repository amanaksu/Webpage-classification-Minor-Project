                  style="font-weight: bold;">helms this inept version of
                  a Norman Mailer novel, as he proves he's too
                  inexperienced to capture what the author was trying to
                  say about the American Dream going wrong. It's ugly,
                  lurid, violent and surprisingly a long haul in tedium,
                  as Gist turns it into an uninteresting trashy pic. But
                  at least it has a chilling opening scene of an
                  embittered and drunken estranged wife falling off the
                  terrace of her penthouse apartment and landing </span><b>dead

                  is now the acerbic muckraker host of a popular
                  syndicated call-in talk show on television that deals
                  in hot-button issues. His most recent show vents

                  refuses saying she enjoys keeping him around to
                  humiliate him with her verbal barbs. After a verbal

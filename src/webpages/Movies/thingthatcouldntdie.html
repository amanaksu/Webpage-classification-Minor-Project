                  found and given to Jessica by Gordon, her would-be
                  suitor, as an apology for doubting her. Digging

                  and Mike guard the valued chest overnight, but its
                  contents intrigue the greedy handyman and he convinces
                  Mike that Flavia gave him permission to open the
                  chest. It turns out </span><span style="font-weight:

                  Hughes</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">), a
                  sixteenth-century devil worshipper, who was punished
                  by Drake for his sins by having his head live forever
                  in search of his corpse buried somewhere else in a
                  casket on the grounds. Drew's head, with hypnotic
                  powers, influences a killing spree as he goes in
                  search of overcoming his curse to become a whole
                  person again by possessing those who hold his head to
                  continue the search. The greedy Flavia and the
                  visitors get caught up in the greed of their
                  discovery, as only the innocent Jessica wants nothing

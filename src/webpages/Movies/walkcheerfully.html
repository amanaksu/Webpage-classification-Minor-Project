                  fast-moving silent film by Yasujiro Ozu </b><b>("A
                  Hen in The Wind"/"Late Spring"/"There Was A Father")
                  was tagged as a gangster film, one influenced by
                  Josef&nbsp; von Sternber's Underworld (1927), though
                  it's filled with comedy and domestic
                  situations--making it just as much a romcom. It has
                  snarling hoods, dressed in fine Western threads,
                  hanging out in pool halls and boxing gyms, and living
                  the good life enjoying their spoils in a changing
                  Tokyo, that is rapidly turning more and more Western
                  from its once exclusive traditional family ways. Its
                  main story tells how a virtuous woman wins the heart
                  of a young punk and he goes straight to be with her.
                  The story revolves around delinquent petty thief Kenji
                  (</b><span class="tabletxt"><span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">Minoru Takada</span></span><b>), known as
                  Kenji the Knife, dreaming of being a boxer, and his
                  loyal but not too swift sidekick Senko (</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Hisao Yoshitani</span><b>).
                  They are first seen as Senko lifts a wallet at the
                  docks and is chased by a mob. When caught and frisked,
                  he's able in the crowd to pass the wallet off to
                  Kenji.<br>

                    traditionalists and those flaunting their new

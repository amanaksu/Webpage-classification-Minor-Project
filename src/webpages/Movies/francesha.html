                  a humble Brooklyn apartment, and who so far have lived
                  as rebels and strayed from permanent relationships
                  with men. Things rapidly change when zany book editor
                  Sophie falls for vulgarian rich businessman Patch (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Patrick Heusinger</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">) and fails to renew her
                  lease on the apartment with Frances, as she moves to
                  Manhattan's Tribeca to room with him in a better flat
                  and hipper neighborhood. This leaves klutzy apprentice
                  dancer Frances on her own, as she just turned down an
                  offer to live with an uninteresting guy (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Michael Esper) </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">because she didn't want to
                  abandon Sophie. Things get worse when Frances's
                  struggling indie dance company won't give her work as
                  promised, and she's left unable to afford an apartment
                  on her own. Frances' aimless post-college day life is
                  seriously challenged, as she remains outwardly cheery
                  but inwardly hurting. Her new roommates are rich nice
                  guy womanizing downtown artist Lev (Adam Driver) and
                  TV writer Benji (</span><span style="font-weight:

                  wanting to do something to change her bad luck,
                  Frances visits for Christmas her nice suburban folks
                  in Sacramento, California, on an impulse treks to
                  Paris for a misspent week-end, and out of desperation
                  returns to her college campus for a short stint
                  working odd-jobs for the college. In the end, a
                  humbled Frances at least manages to reconnect with her
                  best friend Sophie and in a film like this with small
                  ambitions that will have to suffice as a happy ending.<br>
                </span></p>
              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">It's delightful as far as
                  it goes but, if it has a fault, it is that it never
                  goes far enough for us to get beyond its exploratory
                  study of love, friendship, marriage and careerism. It
                  both applauds and warns against women straying too far
                  from society norms, cautioning them how hurtful it can
                  be if things go wrong and there's no support system in
                  place to catch them when they fall. It was awkwardly
                  amusing watching the bumbling Frances stumble through
                  her many difficult life situations, but it was even
                  more painful than funny to take it all in. The
                  coming-of-age pic shuns cynicism, but relentlessly
                  depicts their heroine as sincerely kooky and someone
                  we should believe will survive her ordeal because
                  she's resilient and has no choice but to follow her
                  own spontaneous heart-felt urges. More than anything
                  else, the transplanted New Yorker seems to have found
                  a home not in the secure suburbs many of her
                  classmates might have ended up through marriage but as
                  a true struggling New Yorker dwelling without much
                  income in the city's mean streets.<br>

                </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">pirouette,
                  leaves us thrilled at the sight of a lovely young
                  woman, with an innocent passion for life, to be still
                  in the process of developing to be a real person. It's
                  rare when such a genuine pic is made and pulled off so
                  successfully, that despite not saying enough about its
                  main character's observations it nevertheless deserves
                  to be applauded for trying to say something real
                  that's happening in today's more sophisticated urban
                  settings.<br>

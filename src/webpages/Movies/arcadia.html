                  tells stories, boasts about his new West Coast job and
                  paints a pretty picture of the house they will live
                  in. The kids believe mom will join them somewhere on

                  unpleasant when Tom gets out of control over a number
                  stressful situations. Tension reaches max at the Grand
                  Canyon, when the argumentative dad refuses to pay the
                  $49 entry fee to see the national treasure and reneges
                  on his promise to Nat to visit the site. This leaves
                  Nat crying and Greta becomes so upset that dad kicks
                  her out of the car on a deserted road, but soon comes
                  to his senses and returns to pick her up. They
                  eventually reach their California destination after
                  several more unpleasant situations, and things take on
                  an eerie sense of normalcy when they all realize mom
                  is unable to join them, dad begins work at his new job

                  performance channeling both the "good and bad dad,"
                  while </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ryan
                  Simpkins gets our attention as the confused innocent,
                  totting around a bunny doll, who seems lost on the
                  journey and in need of a few hugs from dad instead of
                  all the grief she gets. The actors make the most out
                  of the material they were given, and the pic works
                  best as a dicey coming-of-age story. The director does
                  a good job letting us see how the kids, under trying
                  circumstances, must learn about life the hard way.<br>

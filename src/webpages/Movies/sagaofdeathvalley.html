                  rundown Circle R ranch has a new young owner from
                  Wyoming, who goes by the name Roy Reynolds but is
                  really Roy Rogers as an adult and has returned looking

                  the ruthless Tasker, whom he obediently calls uncle
                  and is not told about his parents. The unsuspecting
                  lad has a name change to Jerry. This Jerry is quite a
                  violent young cuss, who collects money from the
                  ranchers for Tasker's Mafia-like protection racket and
                  enforces the payment to uncle's unfair water bill. In
                  one raid, Jerry kills Ann's elderly grandfather (</b><b>Lew

                  Kelly</b><b>), a raid to teach the other ranchers a
                  lesson of whose boss in the Valley. But his gang is
                  wiped out when Roy has formed as a response to
                  Tasker's reign of terror a vigilante group from among
                  his cowhands and with his fighting mad foreman Gabby
                  (George 'Gabby' Hayes) prevent further rustling while
                  his identity as the vigilante head is kept secret.
                  Though Roy captures Jerry, after the Meredith murder,
                  something tells him not to kill him and he lets him go
                  (it's like he's a mystic or maybe he saw the pic
                  before and knows the nasty dude is his unfortunate kid

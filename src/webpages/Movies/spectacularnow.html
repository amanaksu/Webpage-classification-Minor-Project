                  is a free-spirit, poor decision-maker and aimless
                  popular high school senior with the gift of gab, an
                  affinity for charming people, hanging with the

                  up drunk one morning on the lawn of a stranger's
                  house. There he meets 'on the cute' his high school

                  style="font-weight: bold;">the sci-fi bookworm. She's
                  sweet, bright and an unpopular nice girl, working a
                  paper route. The opposites begin an unlikely cautious
                  relationship, with the naive Aimee helping the failing
                  Sutter in geometry and Sutter helping to loosen up the
                  senior class dork to be more aggressive in speaking up

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Kyle Chandler</span><span

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Jennifer Jason Leigh</span><span

                  Sutter and Aimee visit his father in a town a few
                  hours away, we understand why his mom kept him away
                  from dad all these years. It becomes apparent, even to
                  the fun-loving Sutter, that he must change and become
                  more responsible or he will end up a dead-beat just
                  like his lush father. It also becomes apparent that
                  Aimee is the perfect match for him, but it takes a few
                  more dramatic scenes and some words of wisdom from mom
                  to make the troubled youngster see that he doesn't
                  have to be like his dad.<br>

                  who put forth their character's struggles with
                  tremendous conviction and guile, but the story loses
                  its natural flow and turns sentimental in the
                  over-played visit to dad scenes. They bring out a </span><span

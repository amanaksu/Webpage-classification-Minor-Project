                  as a reminder that he missed, and wears it around his
                  neck as a war trophy. Filled with hatred toward the

                  Bronson</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">), when
                  they are captured by the renegade war thumping Sioux
                  Crazy Wolf (</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">H.
                  M. Wynant</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">) and
                  his warriors. Before the Indians butcher their two
                  captives, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Walking

                  Coyote's request is honored to have a go at the "run
                  of the arrow."&nbsp; The ritual gives the captives a
                  slim chance of escape, as the Indians fire an arrow
                  that gives the prisoners a head start before pursued.
                  We're told no one has ever survived this ritual. After
                  Walking Coyote dies while fleeing, a collapsed O'Meara
                  is rescued on the trail by </span><span

                  and nursed back to health in the tribal village of
                  Blue Buffalo. When Crazy Wolf spots O'Meara with Blue
                  Buffalo, he abides by the custom that </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">no Sioux may kill one who
                  has survived the run. </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">O'Meara then talks </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Blue Buffalo into letting
                  him join the Sioux nation as a full fledged Sioux, and
                  he takes Yellow Moccassin as his squaw. The couple
                  adopt the mute orphan youngster Silent Tongue (Billy
                  Miller), and O'Meara is content to live as an Indian.

                  DeKova</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">)
                  allows, as a peaceful gesture, the </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Cavalry to build a fort in
                  the Sioux territory, O'Meara acts as a scout for the
                  army engineers, led by the perceptive Captain Clark
                  (Brian Keith)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.
                  After locating the spot agreed upon by both parties to
                  build the fort, the war hungry renegade Crazy Wolf
                  attacks. In the attack Clark is killed and the
                  maniacally ambitious Indian hater </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Lt. Driscol, the same one
                  shot and saved by O'Meara, takes charge and disobeys
                  orders on where to build the fort. Driscoll orders a
                  new site for the fort that's off-limits according the
                  pact between the two parties. It results in the entire
                  Sioux nation attacking the new fort and the captured
                  Driscoll is severely tortured by being skinned alive.
                </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">O'Meara can't
                  bear the cruelty and uses the same bullet he fired at
                  Driscoll in the opening scene to shoot him and put him
                  out of his misery. Realizing he can't be someone he's
                  not, O'Meara leaves the Sioux nation to return to an
                  uncertain future in America.<br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">The forceful, in your face,
                  pic doesn't always work in explaining Indian lore and
                  doesn't break new ground in how to make a cowboy and
                  Indian film, but what it does well is give us an
                  excellent soul-searching look at an unsympathetic
                  anti-hero and humanizes him into someone we might even
                  respect for his courage. The Steiger method acting
                  performance is not for all tastes, but his vigorous
                  performance gets us to see he's a troubled man who
                  can't escape from his troubled&nbsp; roots. O'Meara is

                    reintegrated back into America for the country to
                    survive without rancor. Fuller follows O'Meara's
                    maddening trek to find himself before it's too late
                    to be found, allowing us to see how difficult it
                    would be for the losers, if not given another
                    chance, to again become Americans. 'Dances with
                    Wolves' borrowed its theme from this pic, but this
                    low-budget pic had a power far greater than the
                    big-budget pic and was the more interesting film.<br>

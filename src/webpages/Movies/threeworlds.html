                </b><b>moralistic movie to watch for many reasons, that
                  include the tragic subject matter, the unappealing
                  characters and the story's queasy emotional moral
                  compass. It turns as a well-meaning but sappy soaper,
                  that is executed in a conniving hamstrung fashion that
                  fails to generate the thought and sympathy as expected

                  unlikely melodrama that never creates tension or
                  touches the heart as its hapless characters make
                  initial missteps and never recover from that
                  experience as they try to atone for their early errors
                  by their outlandish later actions. It's co-written by

                  whose mom was a cleaning woman in the Mercedes

                  style="font-weight: bold;">), gives Al a partnership

                  style="font-weight: bold;">), Al while drunk and
                  speeding drives his Mercedes home to the suburbs and
                  hits the illegal Moldavian immigrant Adrian (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Rasha Bukvic</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">). Stopping briefly to
                  check on the vic, the frightened Al, at the coaxing of
                  his buddies, leaves the scene of the accident. The
                  hit-and-run was witnessed by conflicted medical
                  student Juliette (</span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Clotilde Hesme</span><span style="font-weight:

                  style="font-weight: bold;">is in the middle of an
                  uneasy relationship with her demanding philosophy
                  lecturer boyfriend Frederic (</span><strong
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Laurent Capelluto</strong><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">)</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">. Juliette feels bad she
                  couldn't give the police more good information about
                  the accident and on the next day tracks down the
                  illegal immigrant's wife Vera (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Arta Dobroshi</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">) and visits the hospital.
                  Also feeling guilt pangs is Al, who when he visits the
                  hospital is followed by Juliette. The two French
                  natives begin a painfully awkward relationship, one
                  that grows in complexity when the vic dies and Vera
                  suspects that Juliette knows her husband's killer.
                  Do-gooder Juliette feels equally sorry for the torment
                  that Al is going through as she does for the victim's
                  family.<br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">The dramatics were
                  listless, overwrought, hardly believable, schematic
                  and executed in a heavy-handed manner. It's a glossy
                  well-meaning pic, that ambitiously but erroneously in
                  a too shallow a manner tries to tap into the country's
                  immigration problems, into the mindset of a young
                  ambitious upstart who develops second thoughts about
                  his social climbing ways and how people react to love
                  and tragedies in different ways. It tries but fails to
                  say something earth-shattering about how atonement, no
                  matter how much it hurts, is necessary for a good
                  person to regain his moral balance. What I got from
                  it, was how annoying it was to watch such </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">ponderous</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;"> dramatics--especially when
                  the lead actors are so limited in their emotional
                  range that I felt nothing for their suffering
                  characters and the storyline is too painful to watch
                  without squirming in one's seat.<br>

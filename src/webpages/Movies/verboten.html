                  melodrama set in occupied Germany immediately after
                  the fall of the Third Reich. Eschewing subtlety,
                  Fuller's blend of romance and politics clues us in on
                  how messy things were back then in trying to bring
                  democracy to an impoverished Germany. Paul Anka sings
                  the title song during the opening credits. Later on
                  Fuller effectively uses the newsreels of the Nuremberg
                  Trials to show the evil faces of the Nazi war

                  War II, three brave American infantrymen are looking
                  for snipers in the largely destroyed small German town
                  of Rothbach, while on the soundtrack we hear

                  department for </span><span style="font-weight:

                  take to this pic more than others, but if not one of
                  his ace war movies (like The Big Red One, Fixed
                  Bayonets and The Steel Helmet) it's still a powerful
                  one and has more complexities than your standard issue
                  Hollywood war movie. Fuller's storytelling shakes its
                  fist in anger at Germany for allowing a lunatic like
                  Hitler to begin small in 1919 and rise to absolute
                  power in the 1930s, and that it's criminal for the
                  so-called sane German people not to say anything about
                  concentration camps and all the other fascist horrors

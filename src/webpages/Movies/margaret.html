                  drama suffers from six years of legal woes involving
                  production problems that were holding up its release,
                  being overlong, too many unnecessary subplots to deal
                  with (like the suffering guilt-stricken heroine's mom
                  dating a smoothie opera loving SA computer businessman
                  named Ramon), its wrenching heartfelt scenes strike a
                  false note and its unbelievable dramatic contrivances
                  become turn offs. But despite these flaws, the
                  coming-of-age pic has a sense of deeply felt gravity
                  that lingers in a shockingly haunting way as it
                  questions idealism, morality, growing up and doing the
                  right thing. It doesn't bring closure to the grieving
                  process, but asks a lot of the hard questions that
                  have to be asked about getting involved in tragedies

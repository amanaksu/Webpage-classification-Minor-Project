                  someone also not seen for years, </b><b>Cmdr. Ned

                  Bill off by fibbing that she's married and her hubby
                  is on a week-end leave. Since Olive is visiting her

                  welcome by Sally and they dine out in her fancy
                  neighborhood French restaurant. Since Bill is unable
                  to get a hotel room, he stays overnight and acts like
                  the perfect gentleman sleeping alone on the couch. The
                  lovelorn Sally has just been dumped by her gentleman
                  boyfriend, theater producer </b><b>Kenneth Bartlett (</b><b>Kent

                  Smith</b><b>), and the socially awkward and
                  sentimental actress learns over the week-end that she
                  no longer loves the marriage averse Kenneth and
                  thereby hooks up with the regular guy sergeant.<br>

                  earth-shattering, but pleasant, lively and diverting,
                  following the now familiar story arc of "no rooms in
                  town." It reflects the changing times created by the
                  war, whereby a man can sleep in the same apartment as
                  a single woman and the incident not be considered
                  immoral by the modern-day sophisticates. The
                  three-character play is slightly broadened, and
                  transfers well to film. It's alternate title, Voice of
                  the Turtle, is derived from a Bible quote from the </b><font
                  style="font-weight: bold;" face="verdana" size="2">Song

                  of Solomon</font><b>: "The rain is over and the winter
                  is past, and the 'voice of the turtle' is heard in the
                  land." The pic is big on letting us know that once we
                  get rid of the dreary winter that spring is on the way
                  and everything will be joyous.<br>

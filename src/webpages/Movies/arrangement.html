                  Elia Kazan's </b><b>("On The Water"/"A Streetcar
                  Named Desire"/"Baby Doll") first pic since America,
                  America (1963), is a dud. It's an overlong, glum,
                  pretentious and glossy soap opera. It's much like a
                  trashy Harold Robbins novel, telling about a wealthy
                  middle-aged ad executive having a mid-life crisis and
                  trying desperately to find meaning in his empty life.
                  Kazan bases it on his 1967 novel. It wastes a talented
                  cast. To make matters worse, Kazan's attempts at
                  1960's mod film-making techniques of zooms and
                  flashbacks was awkwardly executed.<br>

                  Anderson (Kirk Douglas) is an advertising executive,
                  sitting atop the world, and with a nagging but
                  beautiful, intelligent and loyal wife in Florence
                  (Deborah Kerr). Wifey even tolerates hubby's
                  extra-marital affairs. But apparently not all's well
                  with second-generation Greek immigrant Eddie and his
                  rise to the top, enabling him to live a life of
                  privilege, as he unsuccessfully tries to kill himself
                  by driving his sports car into a truck on the
                  rush-hour freeway. After hospitalized, Eddie comes
                  home and through flashbacks we observe how his
                  liberated married ad executive mistress Gwen (Faye
                  Dunaway), who he fathered a son with, clues him in
                  that he sold his soul to the devil to get rich off
                  doing creative ads for his tobacco client. The
                  recuperating Eddie refuses to return to work, and his
                  mistress abandoned him a year ago when she refuses to
                  be controlled by him. Eddie now spends his days
                  reflecting on what went wrong in his life plan.<br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">The result is a muddled,
                  contrived, vapid and overwrought melodrama. It's as
                  meaningless as its unlikable protagonist's search for
                  meaning in his empty life. Its banal characters have
                  nothing worthy to say. <br>

                  killed a stage driver. The robberies take place ten
                  years after Black Bart was arrested and served a five
                  year sentence and was released on patrol. But Bart
                  never showed for parole, and hasn't been heard from

                  Terhune--and informs them he suspects the stage robber
                  is Black Bart. The executive informs the trio of Black
                  Bart's gambling superstition over threes, his
                  politeness during the robberies and of never using a
                  loaded gun; the Range Busters go separately undercover
                  to Apache Butte, determined to get their man. Crash
                  gambles in the El Dorado, a saloon owned by the shady
                  Miller (</span><b>George Cheseboro</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">) and Brady (</span><b>Frank

                  Ellis</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">). Dusty
                  romances the church going Molly (</span><b>Gwen Gaze</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">), who also attracts Crash.
                  Alibi blends into the town as a ventriloquist. At a
                  town meeting in the school, The Deacon (</span><b>Forrest

                  Taylor</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">) is
                  rewarded for getting Molly's father off booze by
                  having him donate his land so that The Deacon can
                  build a church. This disturbs Miller and Brady, who
                  wanted the valuable town lot to expand their
                  profitable gambling business for when the railroad
                  will come through.<br>

                  Black Bart and the stage robber is only an imposter
                  hiding behind Black Bart's reputation to cover his
                  tracks. Thereby the Range Busters turn their attention

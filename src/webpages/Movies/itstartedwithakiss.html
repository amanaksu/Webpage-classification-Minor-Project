                  attraction and therefore decides sex is off-limits for
                  the next thirty days to see if they have other things
                  in common. The subplot has the military worried its
                  soldiers would embarrass the host nation, Spain, by
                  acting like rich Americans and orders the soldiers to

                  military and soldier Joe over the flashy car and if it
                  should be sent home. There's also an amorous

                  photographed, as it's shot around Mount Whitney.
                  That's where the Hopalong Cassidy series filmed. The
                  pic is too schematic to be more than mildly diverting,
                  as it becomes too talky and hands out a series of
                  lectures on the trail when the action halts on how to
                  deal with evil, violence and people who are rotten.
                  It's final message is that there are enough good
                  people to be found, if you look hard enough.<br>

                  shamed Helen Caldwell (</span><b>Zohra Lampert</b><span

                  acknowledges the marshal's deathbed wish to deputize

                  his power to wrest control from Cole and ruin the
                  mission. The kidnapped girl's Uncle Billy (Royal Dano)
                  takes her back to town when the psychologically
                  crushed vic is found acting suicidal in the desert.
                  Big talking gun crazy Wiley (</span><b>Paul Carr</b><span

                  Cole killed one of the outlaws. Hogan tries to justify
                  his retreat by claiming he was the one who got his
                  brother's killer and has no reason to ride any more
                  with the posse (the truth is that his brother's killer
                  is still on the loose). Soon the only ones left on the
                  posse are the good guys--Cole, a tenderfoot NYC banker

                  going by the bank president (Ray Teal) to watch the
                  money, but acts with courage despite his limits as a

                  style="font-weight: bold;">The big budget $215 million
                  Disney film is humorless (desperately tries to get a
                  laugh from the soon to be Lone Ranger dragged through
                  horse manure), derivative, contrived to be a bloodbath
                  pic and cruel in the way it debunks a virtuous
                  stalwart American hero into a clueless square and a
                  clod. If there was pioneer justice, those who made
                  this awful pic would be punished by getting a bad box
                  office. The untold Lone Ranger story is told through
                  the recollections of an elderly Tonto (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Johnny Depp</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">) in this twisted update of
                  the franchise produced by schlock producer </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Jerry Bruckheimer, who
                  never could resist getting his paws on vulgarizing a
                  pic for the sake of the bottom-line. In this inane,
                  bloated and vexing version, </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">it is Tonto who stars and
                  the Lone Ranger (</span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Armie Hammer</span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">) who plays second fiddle. The Lone Ranger is
                  so lame and unlikable, it's almost impossible to root
                  for him. In this version, Tonto must care about the
                  Lone Ranger's pursuit of white man's justice while the
                  arrogant Lone Ranger doesn't give a shit about the
                  fate of his Indian sidekick.<br>

                  teams with the one he adorns with a mask and renames
                  the Lone Ranger. Their ridiculous adventure story has

                  that started on radio, then as a movie cliff-hanger
                  serial and had a long-run on TV. It gets increasingly

                  and to re-invent the legend in its own small-minded
                  debunking way. It has taken a well-liked and respected
                  family favorite hero and made him into a hapless
                  cartoon character, and pats itself on the back for at

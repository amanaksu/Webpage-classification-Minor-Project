                  V. Cheshire</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">).

                  After retiring from the army, the Captain has
                  dedicated his life to caring for animals at a shelter
                  he built for them. The Captain tells Roy that lately
                  professional hunters are killing deer and wild game
                  out of season with high-powered rifles and he's on the
                  trail of the gang, who are selling the meat illegally
                  for a high profit. <br>

                  after an illegal hunter using a high-powered rifle to
                  kill a buck, but the hunter escapes on foot by jumping
                  into the river as Roy captures the fleeing hunter's
                  horse marked with the brand of the Lazy W Ranch.
                  Meanwhile the Captain encounters the fleeing hunter,
                  Bert (</span><b>Hal Landon</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">), who makes extra money

                  foreman Matt (</span><b>Roy Barcroft</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">). When the Captain has the
                  drop on Bert and the gang and is ready to bring them
                  to the sheriff, Jean comes up from behind and takes
                  his gun. The cold-blooded woman kills the Captain with
                  his own gun and dumps his body back at his ranch,
                  making it seem like an accidental shooting.<br>

                  Frazee</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">) in
                  investigating the new owner of the Lazy W. Meanwhile
                  Bert has misgivings about his actions, especially
                  since the kind-hearted Captain left his ranch to his
                  sister. But the gang won't let him quit, fearing he'll
                  crack and blab. When the town photographer, Cookie
                  (Andy Devine), tells Roy the ranch had a huge
                  refrigeration system put in, the curious Roy gets
                  inside the house to investigate and discovers all the
                  venison and game kept in storage. Now all Roy has to
                  do is escape from the meat freezer he was placed in by
                  Matt and Jean, and he will bag the ruthless poachers.</span></p>

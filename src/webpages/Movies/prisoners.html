                  his rights to be treated as a human being. Meanwhile a
                  number of false leads come up as red herrings, such as
                  a dead body in a priest's (</span><span

                  (the great visuals are </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">from acclaimed

                  bold;">Roger Deakins)</strong><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">. Villenueve frames his
                  ethical questions around the acts of a grieving father
                  and asks what alternatives are there for a citizen if
                  unsatisfied with how the authorities handle your life
                  and death problem. The carpenter is pictured as a man
                  already living on the edge in preparation of an
                  apocalypse, whose illegal actions, caused by a
                  distrust of the authorities, take him over the edge
                  and into dangerous territory where violence has no
                  limits. <br>

                  the base things I question about the exploitative way
                  it handled its far-reaching main character. Not the
                  least of my reasons for enjoying the film so much was
                  how it was effectively and suspense-fully directed,
                  its fine technical achievements without the need of
                  CGI, its assured way of telling its story and because
                  of the great acting by the talented cast--especially
                  by the cool </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">obsessive

                  performance by Jackman, the devout Christian dad

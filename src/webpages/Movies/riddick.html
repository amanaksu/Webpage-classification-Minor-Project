                  third Riddick film in the series is not the charm,
                  though some might find its futuristic sci-fi hokum
                  trappings entertaining for a B-film only in it for a
                  few laughs and to showoff a surly cool tough-guy who
                  takes no shit from anyone. It follows with far less
                  expectations than the weaker Pitch Black (2000) and
                  the commercial flop The Chronicles of Riddick (2004).

                  Fugitive"/"Waterworld"), directed all three episodes,
                  does more with less in this </b><strong>$38 million
                  budget</strong><b> version. In my opinion, the best of

                  creatures--some kind of hybrid jackals (like the pet)

                  mostly unfunny acerbic wit, unremarkable CGI effects
                  and a dry desert antihero fugitive on-the-run story
                  that lacks not only intelligence and drama but a
                  reason for me to care if the franchise continues. I've
                  seen enough. I don't really care whether or not a
                  fugitive like Riddick can ever go home again--which is
                  the note it leaves us with, as its climax prepares us
                  for another episode if it gets a good box-office to be
                  bankrolled again.</span></p>

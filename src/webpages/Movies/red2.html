                  into in a big way at the box office the first time

                  operative Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) retires again and
                  his ditsy civilian squeeze, Sarah (Mary-Louise
                  Parker), try to see if they can obtain domestic bliss

                  style="font-weight: bold;"> Marvin Boggs (John
                  Malkovich) appears at the mall to recruit the
                  reluctant Frank to take a new case to investigate a
                  leak disclosed on the Internet about a top-secret
                  nuclear program called Nightshade from 1979 that
                  threatens the lives of the two former agents, who are
                  falsely accused of a cover-up. When Marvin is
                  seemingly killed in a car bomb at the mall, Frank is
                  arrested and held for questioning by the CIA. But a
                  malevolent ranking Pentagon official, Jack Horton (</span><span

                  interrogation room with a bunch of heavily armed
                  soldiers and kills the CIA agents holding Frank and
                  attempts to bring Frank in for questioning about the
                  leak. But Frank escapes and fantastically kills
                  everyone but Jack, and then suddenly Marvin returns
                  from the dead to partner again with his old buddy.
                  Frank further learns he has become the target of MI6
                  assassin Victoria (Helen Mirren) and the world's best

                  Frank and Marvin bring her along to Europe, as the
                  boys travel in a plane stolen from Han and move from

                  filmmaker and his fellow Hollywood bottom-line
                  creators can shove down the public's throat before
                  there's an outcry for basta! The studio hopes there's
                  still a large audience for such a breezy summer film,
                  one that critics are most likely to disfavor.</span></p>

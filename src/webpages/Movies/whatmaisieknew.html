                  style="font-weight: bold;">A wonderful modernized
                  re-telling of the 1897 Henry James short story. It's
                  crisply written by Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright
                  and earnestly co-directed by regular collaborators
                  Scott McGehee and David Siegel</span><b
                  style="font-weight: bold;"> ("Uncertainty"/"The Bee
                  Season"/"Suture"). The key player is </b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Onata Aprile, who plays the
                  precious neglected six-year-old Maisie. Though all the
                  performances are excellent, it's her sterling
                  naturalistic performance that makes the psycho-drama
                  work so effortlessly. The street savvy Maisie's
                  wealthy narcissistic self-absorbed busy
                  career-orientated NYC townhouse residing unmarried
                  parents, Brit asshole art dealer father Beale (Steve
                  Coogan) and aging rock singer mom Susanna (Julianne
                  Moore), are involved in a bitter custody fight and get
                  shared custody of the child.</span> <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">The sweet perceptive child
                  is tormented as both parents try to win her over with
                  manipulative promises of real love but can't keep
                  their word, as they seem to always leave her in the
                  lurch over some business thing that pops up. </span><br

                  style="font-weight: bold;">One can't help rooting for
                  the resilient child, who absorbs in several touching
                  scenes how she's shuffled off to stay with mom's new
                  hubby, a charming nice guy bartender, one of her
                  hangers-on, named Lincoln (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Alexander Skarsgard</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">), someone she married
                  during an impulsive moment. Or she's shuffled off to
                  stay with her caring former nanny Margo (Joanna
                  Vanderham), who ran away with the egotistical Beadle
                  and married him. Lincoln and Margo eventually get
                  together when abandoned by their spouses, and the
                  strangers offer Maisie the real love she never gets
                  from her warped parents. What comes through is the
                  needless pain inflicted on such an adorable innocent,
                  who only wants to be loved and to return that love.</span>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">It's all viewed through
                  the eyes of the little girl, and serves as a heart
                  piercing timeless tale about a dysfunctional family.</span>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maisie allows us to see
                  that she is perceptive enough to know the difference
                  between pretend love and real affection--which
                  clarifies the meaning of the title.</span><br>

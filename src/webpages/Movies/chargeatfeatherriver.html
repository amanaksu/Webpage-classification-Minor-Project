                  was the biggest grossing Western in 1953 and is

                  scream was used afterwards by many Hollywood films.
                  Though the routine screenplay by James R. Webb is
                  nothing to do a war dance over, the superb direction

                  Madison), who was an expert Indian scout during the
                  Civil War and is now a rancher, to rescue two white

                  fears what the other women would say about her

                  rescuers as the Cheyenne pursue and start picking off
                  the troopers one by one. It reaches a boil when the
                  rescue party learn that the soldiers at Fort Bellows
                  were massacred and their best hope for survival is if
                  Baker and Ryan, sworn enemies, can reach nearby Fort
                  Darby and get help. Meanwhile Archer and his
                  guardhouse brigade must fight off at Feather River
                  several attacks by Chief Thunder Hawk. It ends on a
                  happy note, with victory and Archer asking the
                  grateful Ann to marry him--which seemed hardly
                  believable and only contrived to make a plot point
                  about a shamed white woman made clean again to return
                  to her own kind by our brave and decent hero. <br>

                  Marley are stunning, the Technicolor is pleasingly
                  lush, the Indian-trooper action sequences are
                  well-executed and Guy Madison acts like a star. I
                  always wondered why Madison didn't have more success
                  in movies.</span></p>

                  in Halsey's life, mostly during the battle of
                  Guadalcanal in 1942, when he was commander of the
                  Pacific Fleet. Aside from Cagney's gritty performance,
                  the subdued biopic, shot in black-and-white and in an
                  episodic semi-documentary style, lacks oomph and

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Halsey was born in New
                  Jersey in 1882. He graduated from the U.S. Naval
                  Academy in 1904 and earned his Naval Aviator's wings
                  at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the
                  history of the Navy. Halsey was commander of&nbsp; the
                  Naval sea war in the South Pacific in 1942, giving
                  America its first success in the Pacific with his
                  Guadalcanal victory. Halsey</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;"> was promoted to Five-Star
                  Fleet Admiral in December 1945 and retired from active
                  duty in 1947 to go into business. He died in August
                  1959 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.<br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">The pic was spurned by the
                  public mainly because it eschewed battle scenes for
                  lots of talk, character development and depicting the
                  stress of command. Intelligent war pics without bloody
                  battles are often shot down in this manner by the
                  public, but are often acclaimed, as was this pic, by
                  history buffs for their respect in getting the history
                  right. <br>

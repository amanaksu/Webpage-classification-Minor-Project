                  for a big-game safari in Nairobi, with the hope they
                  can mend things with this exotic adventure and Francis
                  could gather enough courage during the hunt to
                  overcome his annoying cowardly traits--something
                  driving him apart from the wife, who has turned into a
                  bitch whom he still craves despite the way she treats

                  Wilson a questionnaire to fill out overnight in detail
                  about the incident for a jury inquest the next day. In

                  style="font-weight: bold;">With Francis excited about
                  bagging a roaring lion heard in their campsite, the
                  guide takes him to a spot where he gets a clear shot
                  at the lion in the open field. When he only wounds the
                  lion, the hunter tracks the lion to where he is
                  licking his wound in a bush and gives Francis a chance
                  to get the kill and put the lion out of his misery.
                  But when the lion charges, the jumpy Francis turns
                  scared and runs away leaving the guide to kill the
                  lion. Francis's cowardice gets his wife turning
                  hostile to him, breaking her promise to be nice on the
                  trip,&nbsp; and turning romantically to the polite but
                  receptive hunter whom she kisses in front of her
                  humiliated hubby. Meanwhile Francis takes out his
                  disappointment on the native servant and in a rage
                  beats him until separated by the guide. Hoping to
                  redeem himself the next day on a buffalo hunt, Francis
                  seems to be </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">exhilarated


                  about the hunt and despite Margo staying out all night
                  to sleep with the guide and giving him hate, he guns
                  down three buffaloes. When this time a wounded buffalo
                  charges, Robert doesn't retreat but stands his ground
                  and fires. When Margo sees what's happening and
                  realizing hubby is a changed man and is now man enough
                  not to take her bullying anymore and will probably
                  dump her after the vacation, she fires at the charging
                  water buffalo but instead fatally hits her hubby in
                  the back. In the end, Margo wishes to face the jury
                  alone, turning down Wilson's offer to go with her, as
                  she hopes to get it off her chest and tell what she
                  felt when she fired that fatal shot. If she
                  intentionally or accidentally shot her hubby, she's
                  prepared to let the jury decide.<br>

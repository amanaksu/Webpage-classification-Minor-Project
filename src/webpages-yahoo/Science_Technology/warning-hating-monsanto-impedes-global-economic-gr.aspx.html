<p><em>Misconceptions about agricultural biotechnology cost this Zambian his crop -- and thousands of lives -- during a major drought. Source: Richard Lord / UMCOR</em></p>
<p><strong>Monsanto </strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a data-id="202678" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/MON.aspx">MON</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add MON to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=MON">&nbsp;</a>)  attracts quite a bit of criticism for its transgenic crops and seeds, more commonly referred to as Genetically Modified Organisms, or GMOs. The agricultural pioneer has introduced several engineered products aimed at reducing the amount of pesticides, herbicides, and time required during the planting season. In fact, corn and cotton crops that contain genes to produce toxins created from a naturally occurring soil bacterium, <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>, have saved farmers $57 billion in pesticide costs from 1996 to 2011.</p>
<p>Yet despite mountains of scientific and economic evidence pointing to the benefits of transgenic crops, many people in the United States and Europe are vehemently opposed to their use and consumption. Public pressure has even led to the creation of state and national mandates, whether they are pending or already passed as law. That is a luxury when you're surrounded by food 24/7. Sadly, this popular and misguided view of agricultural biotechnology compromises the assimilation of genetically modified foods in African countries. It influences international trade and humanitarian aid, thereby stunting economic growth for the world's poorest people. More worrisome: it costs lives.</p>
<p><strong>The West vs. The Rest<br></strong>In 2001 and 2002, a major drought struck Zambia and Malawi, which caused a food shortage for over three million people. When the international community contributed over $600 million to minimize the social and economic costs of the impending humanitarian crisis Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa rejected American corn for his people, labeling it "poison" for its transgenic properties. While country officials claim no lives were lost in the debacle, official reports show only 11% of food supplies were successfully delivered to citizens in the seven months after an emergency was declared.</p>
<p>President Mwanawasa's negative and misinformed opinion on GMOs was likely influenced by the strict standards of European trading partners. You can browse through <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/dyna/gm_register/index_en.cfm">the list of all transgenic crops approved by the European Commission</a>, but the grand majority of products from Monsanto, Pioneer, <strong>Syngenta</strong>  (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a data-id="205633" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/SYT.aspx">SYT</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add SYT to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=SYT">&nbsp;</a>) , <strong>Dow Chemical</strong>  (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a data-id="203324" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/DOW.aspx">DOW</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add DOW to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=DOW">&nbsp;</a>) , and <strong>BASF </strong> (<span class="ticker">NASDAQOTH: <a data-id="220644" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/BASFY.aspx">BASFY</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add BASFY to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=BASFY">&nbsp;</a>)  are approved for animal feed only. Given the strength of trading partners to the north and the importance of agriculture to African countries, there is little economic incentive to import, export, or trade in transgenic crops -- even if they can save lives at home.</p>
<p>Worse yet, Europe imposes such strict regulations despite its own findings. In a 2009 <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/reports_studies/docs/lt_effects_report_en.pdf">report</a> (link opens PDF) conducted by the Union's Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety titled <em>Long-term Effects of Genetically Modified (GM) Crops on Health and the Environment</em>, researchers concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In more than 20 years of experimental field releases and more than 10 years of commercial cultivation, adverse long-term effects reported in the scientific literature concern (i) the development of resistance in Bt crop target organisms and (ii) tolerance in weeds to complementary herbicides used in (herbicide tolerant) crops. No other long-term effects have yet been established.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that cases of weed and pest resistance are occurring in isolated geographic regions -- and <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/09/22/are-farmers-to-blame-for-superpests.aspx">farmers abusing the advantages of biotechnology are likely the culprits</a>. That being said, the conclusion above is an awfully empty defense of the asserted health risks posed by GMOs, especially when it results in the loss of lives and economic potential of those who can benefit the most.</p>

<p>Let's be clear: there are many more issues plaguing the world's poorest nations: government corruption, pestilence, droughts, starvation, poor family planning, and more. While agriculture and food supplies are just a part of the equation, the industry has many positive feedbacks for these economies at a national level. African countries will continue to struggle to take the next step in economic development -- to more skilled industries -- as long as they struggle to feed their citizens and maximize their agricultural outputs -- a major source of livelihood. Biotechnology can expedite the process.</p>
<p><strong>GMOs as an economic springboard<br></strong>Fast forward a decade and Zambia is now participating in the United Nation's Millennium Village Project, which was developed to address the challenges of extreme poverty by encouraging the use of modern agriculture (high-yield seeds, proper irrigation techniques, and fertilizers), education, health care, and other social development directives. Villages are hosted in more than 20 African countries; including the four used in the GDP comparison above (France continues to ban transgenic corn -- easy to do when agriculture only contributes 2% to your top line.)</p>
<p>Think the advantages of biotechnology are fantasies? Think again, but don't take my word for it. Just take a look at data from the first Millennium Villages to implement high-yield crops:</p>

<p>To be fair, utilizing genetically modified seeds did not account for all of the production gains above. But while transgenic crops are more of an insurance policy -- against the list of things that could possibly go wrong each year -- for American farmers, they are a lifeline for African farmers and local economies. We can't weather-proof seeds (yet), but drought-resistance varieties are exponentially more valuable in Zambia than Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>Foolish bottom line<br></strong>Why can't agricultural biotechnology, with proven results and even greater potential to help the world, distance itself from the negative press? Employing teams of cutthroat lawyers that target the iconic American farmer when she strays from the industry's strict guidelines likely has a lot to do with it. But if we evaluate transgenic crop specialists on the heels of economic and scientific progress alone, it is difficult to argue against them.</p>
<p>So when anti-Monsanto sentiment leads to the passage of just one law banning or restricting the use of transgenic crops in your state, the impacts are felt oceans away. Such bans complicate trade policies and endanger economic growth and the lives of millions of people in the most impoverished nations. Remember that before leaving your thoughts in the comments section below.</p>

They use data from 1951 to 2012 ignoring all data before that as the models they love to quote are frauds just like the fears on Monsantos crops.  In the case of the IPCC they ignor the medievil warm period, the little ice age, CO2 levels from the ice core studies, the hiatus in warming from 1940 to 1980, the cooling from 1880 to 1915, the ice levels in 1000 AD when the vikings settled Greenland and a whole bunch of other data which would make their models blow up.  In the case of crops these people ignor the crop yeilds in this story as that makes thier ideas sound as stupid.</p></p></div>

The &quot;facts&quot; in this article are, as to be expected, misleading. While bt corn and cotton may have saved farmers in pesticide use, the poison is in the plant. Personally, you can provide me with all the industry-rigged testing you want, I'm not going to put this stuff in or near my body or eat animals that have been fed with it. Period. Meanwhile, roundup ready seeds provide a marked increase in the use of this terribly destructive herbicide, which has become famous for spawning bigger, stronger superweeds which require the use of more herbicides including restricted use chemicals . Monsanto wants you to believe that this is due to farmer abuse, but this is a fiction they've recently come up with to help them deflect criticism. Meanwhile, since time immemorial until the 1990s we have enjoyed GM-free food. Monsanto and the other GM producers have introduced NEW ORGANISMS into the food chain and the burden should be placed upon them to adequately LABEL these organisms when they are used as a food ingredient. Instead, Monsanto spends millions upon millions to avoid labeling. They have failed miserably in showing any  responsibility for what they've created and introduced to the marketplace, and this alone places them in the shadows. Clearly, as seed sales show decline they are growing desperate and scrambling. No, Mr. Chatsko, industry shills don't provide wake-up calls - they provide the lullabies that put sheep to sleep. The wake up calls are coming from those who understand the SCIENCE of sustainable soil and plant health - a concept that Monsanto not only doesn't comprehend but does everything in its power to systematically destroy. </p></p></div>

These “fear profiteers” prosper from scare campaigns about food and how it’s produced.  Their support enables activists to foment bogus health and safety fears about GMO crops, thereby helping to drive customers to higher-priced organic offerings while boosting costs through labeling initiatives is only to allow the less efficient organic growers to become more cost-competitive.  </p><p rel="nofollow">As to the claim that &quot;the poison is in the plant&quot;, there are some varieties which include the same protein created by bT. </p><p rel="nofollow">Why bT was chosen should be obvious, because it can and IS widely used by the ORGANIC food producers and for the same reason, there is NO LIMIT on how much or WHEN it can be applied.</p><p rel="nofollow">Indeed you can spray bT on your crop the same day as harvest because neither the USDA or the FDA consider it toxic to humans or farm animals in any quantity. </p><p rel="nofollow">As to use of glyphosate, it is by far the safest herbicide we have ever developed. The amount used is but 1 qt per acre and when used for &quot;Round-Up&quot; ready crops, it is sprayed at the beginning of the growing season so this short lived herbicide is not present come harvest.</p><p rel="nofollow">In contrast, many farmers use Glyphosate at the END of the growing season on non-Round Up ready crops to kill/desiccate the green portion of the plant to make harvesting easier, so it is clear that GMO crops have FAR FAR less of this than non-GMO crops, and yet  the EPA considered a &quot;worst case&quot; dietary risk model of an individual eating a lifetime of food derived entirely from glyphosate-sprayed fields with residues at their maximum levels. This model indicated that no adverse health effects would be expected under such conditions.</p><p rel="nofollow">So go on, continue to spread falsehoods, you are losing the battle . </p></p></div>

No GMO yet invented resists drought. In addition, the cost of these patented seeds is so great that some farmers in poor countries -- who then cannot save seeds to plant another year, under the terms of the patent -- go under. There is another side to this story. To keep that story short, simply consider this: Do you trust the company that brought us Agent Orange to engineer the food supply?

I don't care if monsanto is the greatest company on earth and if their food cures cancer, I want to be able to CHOOSE what I put in my body. I'm not forcing anyone to agree with me.

I recall when ingredient labeling came to pass,( and now food's origin)...people started waking up regarding reading and making decisions based upon ingredients. Major food companies were also, at the time, against labeling. I never buy a food product without reading the ingredients...fat content, artificial content, where it originated,etc. Including my pet's foods ( I buy organic dog food, corn and beet free). Why NOT whether it is GMO or not? If, like others so succinctly state, it's as innocuous as any other ingredient in our food, then I fail to see why Monsanto is so determined to avoid a &quot;proud GMO&quot; declaration? Dairy farmers are stepping up to certify their products are rBHS free, and that has not hurt the Industrial dairy Corpses that still sell rBHS milk, now has it? But that industry fought that labeling, tooth and nail if I recall correctly. Ha! And for the same &quot;Monsanto-reasons&quot;.</p></p></div>

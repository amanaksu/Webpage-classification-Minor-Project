				<p>From fears about Obamacare penalties to the latest breakthroughs in health-care research, The Motley Fool's <em>Market Checkup</em> drills down on the hottest headlines and biggest market movers in the health-care sector. This episode -- featuring a special guest appearance by Dan Caplinger, The Motley Fool's director of investment planning -- highlights a biotech stock that popped 40%, gives a full examination of the Affordable Care Act's debut week, and finishes off with two stocks poised to profit from Obamacare.</p>
<p>In the following video, Dan discusses with Fool health-care bureau chief Max Macaluso and health-care analyst David Williamson how various insurers are benefiting from Obamacare's opening success and the impact of Obamacare penalties on customer demand. Dan notes that <strong>WellPoint</strong>  (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a data-id="206070" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/WLP.aspx">WLP</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add WLP to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=WLP">&nbsp;</a>)  in particular has focused its attention on the Obamacare exchanges and stands to benefit more quickly from their success than rivals <strong>UnitedHealth Group </strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a data-id="205890" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/UNH.aspx">UNH</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add UNH to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=UNH">&nbsp;</a>) , <strong>Cigna </strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a data-id="203121" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/CI.aspx">CI</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add CI to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=CI">&nbsp;</a>) , and <strong>Aetna </strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a data-id="202742" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/AET.aspx">AET</a></span>&nbsp;<a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add AET to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=AET">&nbsp;</a>) . Yet Dan also points out that we have yet to see whether many of those who went to health-exchange websites will actually buy insurance and, if they do, whether they'll go with exchange options from WellPoint and other exchange participants or seek outside products like the ones UnitedHealth and its peers offer.</p>
<p>David notes that investors in Cigna, Aetna, and UnitedHealth shouldn't be too alarmed if those companies fall behind, noting that they have reputations for being conservative. Dan concludes by speculating that many Americans could be concerned and intimidated by Obamacare penalties, describing how the penalties could impose extra costs of either $95 or 1% of income over a certain threshold, whichever is greater, for 2014. Although those penalties will rise substantially in future years, just the existence of a small penalty for 2014 seems to be enough to be driving Americans to get information about Obamacare, and that could help insurers throughout the industry in the long run.</p>

  <p><strong>Should you be scared of Obamacare?</strong><br>Even if the penalty provisions under Obamacare aren't as draconian as some think, plenty of Americans have other worries about the law's future impact on their personal finances and the government's long-term fiscal viability.

Obamacare is an attack on Christians who know their unalienable right to Liberty comes from our Creator, not from a centralized politburo of elitist rulers greedy for absolute power and the wealth of others.  Liberty is not just the absence of chains; it is the freedom to make individual choices about one’s personal life, choices that do not infringe on the rights of others.</p><p rel="nofollow">2.	Obamacare is about eliminating citizen’s right to choose personal courses of action under penalty of fine and imprisonment, and forcing them into subservience.</p><p rel="nofollow">3.	Obamacare is about implementing man’s law to destroy the Supreme Law of the land established by our Creator and documented by our Founders in the Constitution; namely the 4th Amendment which guarantees the citizens the right to privacy of their “personal papers,” which includes their personal medical and banking records.</p><p rel="nofollow">4.	Obamacare is about taking control of $5.1 Trillion private sector U.S. capital created annually by our insurance and health care industries.</p><p rel="nofollow">5.	Obamacare is about increasing the power of the centralized politburo by eliminating the power of the people.</p><p rel="nofollow">H.L. Mencken said, “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.”</p><p rel="nofollow">Mencken also said, “The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false-face for the urge to rule it.”</p><p rel="nofollow">Thomas Jefferson said, “Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.”</p><p rel="nofollow">Obamacare is the will of tyrants, not the will of the people. </p></p></div>

I thought they whole idea was that EVERYONE would have &quot;access&quot; to health care. No one thought this whole thing through before passing it. (We know they didn't read it.) Have you heard of an plan for more doctors, since there will be more patients? Basic math and economics be damned, this is just another method of wealth redistribution.</p></p></div>

These are very meaningful questions; and for those of us that remember Hitler and World War II, they are very meaningful and open old wounds and fears.  Getting rid of Hitler and Fascism and the widely displayed flag with the swastika cost thousands of American and other free world country’s individual lives.  For those of us old enough to remember those days of old we began to attach programs and movements of a group called the “Tea Party”, a group of very influential people that are in United States of America politics today. We must begin today.  All members of the House of Representatives come up for re-election in November 2014.  All GOP members of the House of Representatives share responsibility for the government shutdown that occurred on October 1, 2013, especially Tea Party members who’s action mirror the Fascists of Hitler’s days in power.  We, the people, must demonstrate, by voter participation that we are in charge of the United States of America.  We, the people, MUST NOT vote for any Republican to fill a position in the United States of America House of Representatives.  Remember what these people have done to American people in the past few years.  On 1 October 2013 the House Republican members of  the Congress shut down the United States government because they did not get their way and cut 150 million people out of available medical care by eliminating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the GOP voted more than 40 times to repeal this law but failed every time; the GOP does everything it can to make sure the poor remain poor and the middle class is reduced to poverty.  They could not accept that the President of the United States of America is BLACK (isn’t this a belief of Hitler and his followers). Look at other crippling changes supported by the same GOP, 1) in 2006 they enacted a law requiring advanced money payments that has crippled the U.S. Postal, 2) they enacted laws and made adjustments in federal and state operations that greatly cripple women freedom of choice rights, and 3) they fights to cut much needed services such as Social Security, retirements, including military capability, that makes America appear to all foreign countries as a downward spiraling Nation without leadership, 4) they demand drastic reductions in the food stamp program that is needed to insure our hungry, mostly single mothers and kids, are fed at the minimum healthy levels, 5) they supports legislation in every state that would restrict voting rights of blacks, Hispanics and  whites that support Democratic candidates or beliefs. We must replace these radical members of the United States Congress and show them that, we, the people, still run this Country. Should the GOP candidate have no challenger write in the name of your local Police Chief or someone else you and trust?</p></p></div>

Unless there are financial incentives to participate (large penalties for non-participants, or denial of coverage for non-participants that attempt to obtain coverage after becoming ill), then exchanges will be bogged down with only the elderly and the infirm, meanwhile the brunt of the financial burden is born by those least likely to access services - the young and healthy.  In other words, state that for access to healthcare services, participation is mandatory.  Of course, government is not going to do this because this would be &quot;calling a spade a spade&quot; by admitting that the ACA is social medicine.</p></p></div>

						<div class="commentPost"><p><p rel="nofollow">To answer the question: No, Obamacare is not scaring Americans into buyiing insurance. It is creating a fear among the lower middle class (or should I refer to that segment as 'what's left of the near extinct middle class') that they will be criminalized for not having the financial means to purchase health insurance. Premiums are on the rise and with the increase in income taxes we are all feeling this year, we are bringing home less of what we earn. Five pounds of ground beef was $6.98 five years ago and is now $14,59 (Walmart), gas prices have doubled and it is harder to obtain a mortgage and rentals have nearly doubled in cost in that same time (four years ago, a two bedroom apaartment in this area was $795 monthly and now they are $1,390) For people that are living week to week and paycheck to paycheck, the issues run deep because they are making about 60% of what they earned five or six years ago and it costs twice as much to live. That creates a convergance of income and cost of living that doesn't allow for additional expendatures, and if a person has no additional income and the high cost of food and housing doesn't come back down, there is just no wiggle room to add health insurance at any price.These are the people whose income is above the egregiously low poverty level that would qualify them for assistance, yet below the actual cost of living. Unfortunately figures like CPI are completely erroneous in that they include luxury items and high tech electronics that have either remained stagnant or risen very little in cost of acquisition to the consumer. There is a large portion of the US population that can't fit these items into their budget and are affected only by the rising cost of life's necessities. For these people, a bonus on their tax return is not going to give them the funds when their rent or mortgage payment is due. Ex post facto reimbursement is therefore a either horrible and naive concept by Xanax addicted crackpots, or a deliberate attempt to render the final crushing blow to Americas back bone. I'm not a conspiracy theorist and realize most politicians are just those who somehow, by the grace of God or openess their parent's wallet, managed to graduate from law school but lack the intelligence or ambition to become actual practicing attorneys that work for a living, so I would have to assume that they overlooked this out of pure Washington stupidity. This is why intelligent Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike, oppose Obamacare, not because because of party lines. </p><p rel="nofollow">Those for or against any issue simply due to party affiliation are obviously blindly following a sewer tide of morons, so no further discussion on them.</p><p rel="nofollow">The other issue: freedom to chose. </p><p rel="nofollow">Forcing this potential hardship on Americans is a 1) a socialist concept and </p><p rel="nofollow">2) it will elliminate other choices that Americans would have regarding where they are going to spend their finances. </p><p rel="nofollow">e.g. The toothless redneck that lives in a $5,000 trailer and drives a $40,000 monster truck may be a complete idiot and have made the wrong decision by buying a brand new monster truck when he lives in a roach infested, rusted out mobile strucure and has no health insurance. Obviously a used Ford Focus and teeth would have been a better idea, but it is his right as an American to make those bad decisions with his money and from the sales person at the dealership to workers on a production line, that $40K went back into the US economy. </p></p></div>

If you live in a high crime area in Chicago you'll pay more for insurance than if you live in (shudders) Iowa. They still have their guidelines as to what insurance will cost them to make a profit.  Some insurance companies just pulled out of certain states altogether.  The lack of competition lets the companies that are still there charge more.</p><p rel="nofollow">Eventually, word of mouth will pick the best companies in each area.  Soon, your neighbor will be telling you how good his insurance is compared to yours and you'll switch companies. </p><p rel="nofollow">I worked in government for years.  Every year we got a big book full of insurance companies- the same book my congressman gets- and I get to pick which company I want.  I stuck with the same company for years, even though everyone told me 'Cigna is better., or that 'Blue Cross is the best and has the most doctors signed up for it.'</p><p rel="nofollow">Now YOU have the same options your congressman has.  Pick the best company at the best price.  </p><p rel="nofollow">Of course, all over the country a bunch of rubes are going to pick the absolute cheapest insurance, with a super high deductible.  When they get sick the insurance company is going to have to explain to them  that they won't pay until the customer pays the $3000.00 deductible first.  Then they'll be on Fox News saying how they got ripped off by Obama-care.  So, if you want insurance, try to get one with a reasonable deductible.  </p><p rel="nofollow">Once word gets out that one company is doing a great job at a cheaper price people will switch and flock to that company.  It'll make the competition make that company treat its customers better or lose money.  It's called capitalism, which is new to the world of insurance.</p><p rel="nofollow">I'll end this by saying that we SHOULD have socialized health care- a single payer system, just like all of the other civilized countries in the world that get better health care than us at half the cost.  But, this is the most we could muster.  </p><p rel="nofollow">It only takes a handful of rich individuals to threaten to give tons of money to your congressman's opponent in the next election if you fall out of lock step with their agenda.  A lot of the Republicans know this is a horrible system of threats and bribery, but their hands are tied.  Vote NOT to repeal Obama care and you're done politically. They can't even vote their conscience (not that they have consciences).</p><p rel="nofollow">Try to ignore the Fox News spin on how evil this all is and remember, YOU now have the same system as your senator and congressman.  And DON'T get the cheapest insurance.  You never know what's going to happen to you, even if you're young.  I always paid a little more, but in the long run it was worth it.  Whenever I went to Wal-Mart to pick up my prescription I watched the five people ahead of me being told by the clerk, &quot;Your insurance doesn't cover this medicine, that'll be $500.00.  I always pay next to nothing for my medicine.  And when I go to any doctor I only pay an $18.00 co-pay.  (And even that is to try and stop me from going to the doctor every time I sneeze twice, which a lot of people do, especially older people.)  And look at the 'preferred provider's' list on whatever company you picks web site; that way you can keep your doctor.  He or she is probably on their anyway.  Besides, you probably feel comfortable with him/her because they were the first doctor you went to and you're used to them.  Picking doctor's is a crap shoot anyway.</p><p rel="nofollow">And as an added benefit it saves (according the the non partisan Congressional Budget Office) about 123 BILLION dollars off the deficit in the next ten years, with more to come after that.  </p></p></div>

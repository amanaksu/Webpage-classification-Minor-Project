                  A Woman Ascends The Stairs"/"Late Chrysanthemums"/"Two

                  sensitive woman who falls hopelessly in love, suffers
                  greatly when her love is not returned and is
                  humiliated by how the men in her life treat her as a

                  excellently scripted by </b><b>Yoko Mizuki from the </b><b>novel

                  by the female author Fumiko Hayashi. The film uses

                  and follows Peggy to Sunset studio. There the Falcon
                  hears a shot fired from a sound stage and finds the
                  corpse of leading man Ted Miles, but the body
                  disappears when reported to the studio. Later it's
                  found in the prop room. Miles is married to costume
                  designer Roxanna (</span><b>Jean Brooks</b><span

                  a divorce. The icy Roxanna left her hubby and plans to
                  marry the film's harried autocratic director Alec
                  Hoffman (</span><strong>Konstantin Shayne</strong><span

                  insistence that he's here on vacation and wants no
                  part in the murder investigation, he gets drawn into
                  the investigation when he locates the missing murder
                  weapon in a plaster statue on the studio grounds. That
                  turns out to be the stolen gun of </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">the Shakespeare-quoting
                  British producer </span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Martin Dwyer (</span><b>John Abbott</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">), who claims the picture
                  is jinxed and worries he'll lose all his money because
                  of shooting delays. <br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Before solving the mystery,
                  the Falcon also uncovers info about a valued ruby ring
                  from India owned by Dwyer, that the wealthy womanizer
                  Miles was an investor in the film and had accumulated
                  large gambling debts he couldn't meet, that the
                  gun-toting Louie was also an investor in the film, and
                  that Lily was upset that Peggy got her part. <br>
                </span></p>
              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">It ends as neatly as all
                  the Falcon films do, but if the story is a familiar
                  one then the lively presentation trumps that and keeps
                  the predictable thriller watchable.</span></p>

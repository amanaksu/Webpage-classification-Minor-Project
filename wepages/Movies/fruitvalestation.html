                  leaves us with an emotionally gripping and
                  heart-pulling murder story based on a real incident
                  that took place at the BART station in the Bay Area on
                  the New Year's Eve of 2008, when a white officer
                  fatally shot the 22-year-old handcuffed ex-con Oscar
                  Grant (</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Michael B.
                  Jordan), placed on the station platform with his black
                  friends for disturbing the peace on the train. The
                  senseless shooting led to community riots </span><b>over

                  racial profiling and police brutality and the two
                  officers involved were fired while the shooter was
                  later convicted of an </b><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">involuntary </span><b> manslaughter charge and
                  served an 11-month prison sentence. The drama, filmed
                  like a documentary, records the last 24-hours of the
                  victim's troubled life and tries to put a positive
                  spin on the career criminal's flawed life--humanizing
                  him as someone who was trying to put his troubled past
                  behind him. <br>

                  for dramatic feature and the Audience Award for U.S.
                  dramatic film at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. It
                  can be viewed as an advocate for justice film that
                  puts a human face on its rather charming but
                  unpleasant subject, as it manipulates things so it

                  improperly while failing to place proper

                  style="font-weight: bold;">I don't think the pic's
                  positive take on the unemployable, headstrong,
                  irresponsible, aimless and confused criminal subject
                  made him into a martyr, but serves to point out
                  instead the large gulf in this country between black
                  and white attitudes and how violent society is even
                  over a simple arrest because of the ongoing animosity
                  shown between the hostile youths and brutish police.<br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;"> video recordings of the
                  shooting popped up on YouTube, which is shown in the
                  beginning, giving the viewer a sense of the chaotic
                  situation but not clarifying what happened because the
                  images were too murky. Though the well-intentioned pic
                  is excellently executed and the acting by Jordan and </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Spencer are smashing, it
                  fails to tell us more than what we already think we
                  know about the incident and its further ambitions to
                  go beyond the headlines and lead us to think the
                  victim's POV is the final arbitrator in the incident
                  is arbitrary; especially, since it's pointed out the
                  vic is a liar, his changeable character veers to the
                  bad side when he gets hotheaded and the public's
                  emotions run high because of the racial nature of this
                  tragedy--each race might see things from its own
                  experiences. For me, the truth that this film tells is
                  that there's still a race problem in the country
                  despite the election of a black president.<br>

              <p><b>"We need myths to live by" says the heroine, Estelle
                  (Randy Danson), who is in a conflict with her sister
                  over the same man. Somehow Rappaport concocts a mythic
                  love tale around this simple premise. It is similar in
                  some aspects to the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, whereas
                  Orpheus rescued his love from Hades even though he was
                  told by the gods not to look back or she would
                  disappear. But he did look back because of his
                  insecurities and fear that Eurydice would think that
                  he didn't care for her anymore.</b> </p>
              <p><b>The estranged relationship of the sisters, Estelle
                  and Lena (Jones), is somewhat reconciled as they start
                  living together after a long absence. Estelle lets her
                  live with her, even though she would rather not have
                  her there. Soon they find themselves in the delicate
                  position of having gone out with the same man, an
                  extremely muted Paul (Kevin). He forms a relationship
                  with each of the sisters; first with Estelle and then
                  by coincidence, he meets Lena. But he fails to fulfill
                  his fantasy of having a sexual relationship with both
                  of them at the same time.</b> </p>
              <p><b>This film is distinguished by its stylish use of
                  opera, classical painting, and Victorian soap opera
                  dramatics, to get across its strange wit and
                  Rilkean-like observations of what can be seen from
                  life when you become a passive observer. The observer
                  is Estelle, who pictures herself as if she was the one
                  she is seeing when she looks out at a world she feels
                  imprisoned by.</b> </p>
              <p><b>It could be a very witty movie if you are receptive
                  to the characters' personality foibles, as they mock
                  or imitate what the real-life troubled modern
                  heterosexuals in NYC might feel. Paul is the tall,
                  dark, silent type of he-man, who is animalistic in his
                  attraction to both sisters. Estelle is the romantic
                  soul, who is also endowed with beautiful breasts; and,
                  her more down to earth sister, Lena, who is not the
                  romantic type but is more prosaic in her outlook; Lena
                  is attractive but suffers from psychological problems
                  and fits of violence.</b> </p>
              <p><b>Violence somehow plays into the motifs of the story,
                  as there is talk of a serial killer on the loose in
                  the city. This prompts Estelle to say, "She is afraid
                  to go outside and she is afraid to stay inside." She
                  even thinks that her ex-husband, Jack (Grant), might
                  be the killer, since he is prone to acting hostile at
                  times.</b> </p>
              <p><b>The film lives by the creed that everyone has a deep
                  emotional problem they can't handle. Everyone is meant
                  to be a cartoon character, even more so when they take
                  themselves seriously.</b> </p>
              <p><b>When Lena confronts a stalker by coming on strong to
                  him, she chases him away as he absurdly tells her he
                  should get the cops on her.</b> </p>
              <p><b>Estelle provides the voice-over and from the diary
                  she is writing, we get her observations about romance
                  with comments such as: "Men are attracted to women who
                  wear a wedding band because it is a challenge for them
                  to conquer a married woman." She also comments on her
                  consuming jealousy and mistrust of others even those
                  she once loved, like Jack, Paul, and Lena.</b> </p>
              <p><b>Estelle becomes a representative of all bitchy women
                  who are wrongfully hurt in a relationship, or those
                  too consumed in their fantasy world to ever form a
                  lasting relationship. The film's aim is to be absurdly
                  humorous about this. Even the final scene, where she
                  at lasts burns her diary (similar to the Women Lib bra
                  burnings) can be taken both as comic or dramatic
                  theatrics.</b> </p>
              <p><b>This is a very unusual and original work, that is
                  sometimes slow-going, covering far too much ground for
                  its own good. Men come off as the pawns for women to
                  move around as they please. Paul is seen as an
                  insignificant stud, a servicer of the female race.
                  Jack is seen as an untrustworthy spouse, capable of
                  violent acts.</b> </p>
              <p><b>This film should appeal to urban dwellers who have
                  been in a triangular heterosexual relationship and
                  came out of it more confused than when first entering
                  it, and to those who have a more tolerant and
                  sophisticated attitude toward impossible
                  relationships. And as Estelle so ably says, after her
                  diary burning, "I need some new myths for my life, the
                  old ones don't work anymore." It's a parody of the
                  Orpheus myth; and, as Estelle says, "she gave Paul two
                  chances to get her out of hell, but he failed both
                  times: Orpheus was given only one chance."</b> </p>
              <p><b>The funniest line in the movie is reserved for Paul,
                  who tells Estelle: "I wouldn't even tell you a lie,
                  much less the truth." I think that line summarizes
                  what the movie is ultimately about.</b> </p>

                  reporters take the cub reporter out drinking all night
                  at various nightclubs and get him to pick up the tab.
                  Tagging along is the vengeful mentally-ill meek flower
                  peddler Benny (</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">George


                  E. Stone</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">), who

                  he was picked up as one of the usual suspects who
                  frequents the Broadway area. When Benny, who
                  mistakenly killed Gladys with poisoned coffee meant
                  for Floyd, for messing with his imagined girlfriend
                  Gladys, drops a key clue to the drunken Randall that
                  the murder took place on a waterfront houseboat and a
                  drunken Randall phones that headline grabbing tip into
                  his editor, he's made the lead reporter on the murder
                  case when the tip pans out. Things get hectic with
                  Randall when punked by O'Malley, who poses over the
                  phone as a gangster threatening Randall to drop the
                  story and Randall is also threatened in a home visit
                  by the real gangster Floyd. It leads to a lively </span><span

                  looked like one of Roach's Keystone Kop comedy skits.

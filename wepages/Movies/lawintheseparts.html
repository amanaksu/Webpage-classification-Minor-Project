                    permanent, do justice to the long occupation and the
                    problem of the Jewish settlers. The legal framework
                    behind the laws of the occupied territories is
                    thoroughly explored with archival footage and </span></span><span

              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
                font-weight: bold;">The complex documentary, much like a
                law school seminar, is of interest mainly to a limited
                audience of the chosen few interested in the nuances of
                the Palestinian problem. For those willing to sit
                through the slow-moving and somewhat dry law school-like
                lecture, it offers the chance to better understand the
                conflict through the intense interviews with the legal
                types who administered and justified the occupation. It
                results in a compelling indictment of Israel's
                occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which might
                not please all those concerned. But it does let us see
                how the situation is festering, and how it has gotten so
                much worse over the years. Revelations that were too
                obvious for me to get too excited about its damning
                pronouncement.<br>
              </p>
              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
                font-weight: bold;">Those interviewed sit <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">at a desk on a raised
                  platform</span> and are asked difficult questions by
                off--screen interviewer <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;"><span class="itemprop" itemprop="name">Alexandrowicz,</span></span>
                while the large green-screen behind them will offer
                frequent projections of Palestinians arrested and other
                such inflammatory incidents. If you can sit through this
                odd way of making a documentary then the provocative
                human rights film, whose legalese seems muddled, should
                help the open-minded viewer to further assess the
                difficult occupation situation. After viewing the
                self-indulgent and self-questioning documentary you will
                at least understand why the Israelis make the
                Palestinians live under the new laws and not have them
                live by the laws in place for Israelis, as it's clear
                the Israelis don't want them in the future to become
                citizens. It's not the kind of film you can easily
                dismiss or say wholeheartedly that you support, which
                doesn't make it either a bad or great film--but it's a
                relevant one.<br>

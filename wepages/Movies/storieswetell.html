                  sisters, Susy and Joanna, </span><b> to talk in a
                  homey setting about their vibrant actress mom Diane
                  (viewed on home-movies). Diane died in 1990 of cancer
                  when Sarah, the youngest of the five children, was 11.
                  The focus of the film is drawn to the question of who
                  is Sarah's biological father, as she investigates as a
                  teenager the rumor that mom had an affair in 1978 when
                  she was on stage in Montreal for two months in the
                  play titled "Toronto" and left her two children with
                  Michael in Toronto. A DNA test in 2007, at last, gives
                  Sarah the certainty of knowing who is her biological
                  dad. The film's point is that memories can't be
                  completely trusted when we tell stories about our
                  lives and how our narratives have a tremendous
                  influence in how we live our lives. <br>

              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>The
                  intelligent candid family film has a profundity about
                  dealing with life's intimacies, a winsome acerbic
                  sense of humor, is deeply moving and it paints a
                  poignant picture of the human condition. The filmmaker
                  navigates a bumpy course over family matters but films
                  with care for others while searching for the truth in
                  the difficult stories that unfold and offers a
                  sensitivity for telling one's story in a way not to
                  hurt others no matter the shocks or unexpected that
                  might pop up. Another filmmaker might not have been as
                  delicate and compassionate in telling such a story and
                  thereby not have reached such splendid heights.<br>

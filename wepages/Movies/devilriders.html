                  partners in a pony express line, with Fuzzy the
                  blacksmith and Bill the rider, and their competition
                  is the stagecoach line owned by Tom Farrell (</span><b>Frank
                  LaRue</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">) and his
                  daughter Sally (</span><b>Patti McCarty</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">). The government has given
                  Farrell a contract to build new roads in the Badlands
                  (a wide-open desolate territory without law and order
                  and a place where outlaws
                  use as a hideout). Crooked lawyer Higgins (</span><b>John

                  Merton</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">) and oily
                  investor Stone (</span><b>Charles King</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">) previously controlled the
                  Badlands and fear a safe road will destroy their
                  outlaw investment and will bring to the territory
                  decent folks and the law. When the government offers
                  new contracts for the mail delivery business, the evil
                  duo plot to make it look like Farrell stole Carson's
                  horses and shot Tom in revenge. But Tom lives and
                  tells the sheriff that Bill didn't shoot him. The
                  rivals vow to become partners, and since the baddies
                  couldn't drive a wedge between the rivals they now
                  escalate their plans to put both out of them out of
                  business by going on a killing and robbery spree. Bill
                  takes over rebuilding the road and the boys retrieve
                  their horses in the Badlands. It leads to a final
                  shootout in the Grand Canyon turf in the Badlands,
                  where the thugs are put out of business and the
                  Farrell &amp; Carson partnership in the stagecoach
                  line is official and prospers, as the Pony Express
                  gives way to progress.</span></p>

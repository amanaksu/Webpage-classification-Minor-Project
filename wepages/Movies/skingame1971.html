                  superficial satire on slavery that's told through the

                  pretends to be the master of his black slave Jason
                  (Lou Gossett Jr.). In reality Jason was born a free
                  man in New Jersey, and the two confidence men go from
                  town-to-town in Missouri with Quincy repeatedly
                  selling Jason and soon after freeing him and splitting
                  the money. Things change for the pair in Kansas, </b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">where there's a heated
                  referendum over Kansas' admission to the Union as a
                  slave or Free State. </span><b>In this unstable
                  political climate, Quincy falls for the pickpocket con

                  slave Naomi (</b><b>Brenda Sykes</b><b>), who is being
                  sold at the same slave auction. Jason convinces Quincy
                  to buy her, and it cost him a $1,000. The group is
                  then separated when abolitionist John Brown (Royal
                  Dano) and his followers liberate the slaves. When
                  Quincy follows the wagon tracks to try and reunite

                  must contend again with the ruthless runaway </b><b>slave

                  hunter and dealer Plunkett (Ed Asner), who tries again

                  Duggan) holds the slaves in his plantation, after made

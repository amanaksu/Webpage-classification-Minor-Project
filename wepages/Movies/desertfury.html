                  Hanson (Burt Lancaster), a transplanted Texas champion
                  rodeo rider, who can't ride the rodeo circuit any more

                  proposition to Paula, who freaks out that her mom is
                  trying to run her life and rushes foolishly into the

                  style="font-weight: bold;">The story is such a bummer
                  that the pic really doesn't stand much of chance, and
                  its contrived happy ending seems a travesty. That it
                  succeeds somewhat is only because Astor and Corey both
                  give fascinating crazed hyper performance as pervs.
                  Lancaster is a fine presence, but is not asked to do
                  much in his hero role except show us that a real man
                  is brave and honest and treats women decently. Hodiak
                  is the weakest link in the pic, who portrays a
                  neurotic and always angry racketeer in a
                  one-dimensional emotional tone and maybe he's so
                  screwed-up because he's hiding his homosexual
                  relationship with the Corey character. But the Hodiak
                  character has the film's snappiest one-liner--telling
                  his nagging nursemaid mentor Johnny that he always
                  keeps the blinds drawn in his room because "I like the
                  sunlight in its place, outside." <br>

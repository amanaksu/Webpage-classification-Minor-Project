                  look at the band by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock</b> <b>("Freakonomics"/"Mansome"/"Super

                  Size Me") is so superficial that it tells nothing
                  about the good looking boys that even whispers of
                  their private life--refusing to even show girlfriends
                  or present any negatives, but telling us between their
                  well-choreographed teenybopper songs that the sweet,
                  down-to-earth, mother-loving boys are normal, have a
                  great group camaraderie, love playing pranks and are
                  very appreciative of their surprising sudden success
                  owing it all to their fans. That their music is crap
                  and that they behave like well-trained puppets and
                  have no personality doesn't seem to mean squat, as
                  their mercurial rise in world-wide popularity is
                  compared by the filmmaker to Beatlemania. We follow
                  the lads on their concert world-tour (2011-2012) and
                  take in the adoration they receive from their idol
                  worshipping female teen fan base from live concert
                  coverage in places like Madrid, Mexico City (filling

                  hard-working boys, now on the road for a few years and
                  aged somewhere between 19 and 20, taking a work break
                  to return to their home towns, where they catchup with
                  their loving families and recent past--one grateful
                  mom is teary-eyed that her son bought her a new home
                  and another lad returns to the bakery where he worked
                  before to get some hugs from the cheerful old ladies

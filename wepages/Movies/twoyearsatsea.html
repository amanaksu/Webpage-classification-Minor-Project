                  style="font-weight: bold;">The debut feature film for
                  the British short film director Ben Rivers, who is
                  also the producer/editor/cinematographer of this
                  fascinating study of a self-sufficient man living with
                  nature somewhere in the wilds of the </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Aberdeenshire forest</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">. It's a non-commercial
                  documentary, a high-concept experimental film that is
                  shown in museums and arthouses and not in the
                  multiplexes. The quiet film is almost dialogue free,
                  except for the subject mumbling once in a Scottish
                  brogue about his chesty cough, and pushes no agenda
                  and thankfully comes without talking heads. The
                  40-year-old Rivers treks to the isolated woods in the
                  Scottish Highlands to film the late middle-aged Walt
                  Whitman bearded recluse Jake Williams, living in
                  isolation with his black pussy cat in </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">a dilapidated abode. Rivers
                  uses a </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">hand-cranked

                  16mm Bolex camera</span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;"> to film Williams, someone he filmed before for
                  his 2006 short &#8220;This Is My Land.&#8221; The context of the
                  film has Rivers </span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">unobtrusively filming Williams doing his daily
                  routines, such as preparing chow, chopping wood,
                  sleeping on a homemade raft while fishing in a
                  desolate loch, and listening to country tunes on his </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">gramophone</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">. It's not mentioned but I
                  read that this is the dream life Williams always
                  aspired and spent two years at sea with the Merchant
                  Navy to financially realize his dream of surviving
                  alone in the woods. Like in the Robert Flaherty
                  documentaries that started this genre, Rivers was
                  coaxed into several activities by the director to
                  bring more excitement to the documentary. <br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Though not a film for all
                  tastes for those idealistic nature lovers who will
                  take to it, it will probably be a mesmerizing
                  experience because of its unstated radical
                  proclamations and unflinching voice against bourgeois
                  consumerist living.&nbsp; <br>

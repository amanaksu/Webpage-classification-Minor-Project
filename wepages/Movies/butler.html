                  to tell the story of how African-Americans looked at

                  American Dream is always alive no matter the dire
                  circumstances, serves as a shaky manipulative history
                  lesson, one that has some rousing genuine moments (the
                  crosscutting of Woolworth lunch counter sit-downs in
                  the segregated south with WH fancy state dinners) but
                  far too many sentimental ones. It reminds one of the
                  old-fashioned prestige films the studios felt
                  obligated to make back in the day to satisfy their
                  social consciences and to let everyone know they're
                  not always in the business for the bottom-line and

                  lucks out by hooking up with the sympathetic elderly
                  North Carolina hotel butler (Clarence Williams III).
                  He takes Cecil under his wings and into service in the
                  hotel and teaches him all the tricks of the trade. As

                  by maitre d&#8217; (Colman Domingo) into what it takes to be
                  a servant in the WH ("keep politics out of the WH")
                  and is befriended by the </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">head butler (Cuba Gooding).
                  Cecil learns that the same rules of being invisible
                  that were applicable in his plantation servitude also
                  apply here, as the main rule to be obeyed without

                  see nothing and hear nothing</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">. The most interesting
                  dynamics of the film was watching Cecil operate in
                  such a vacuum, while presidents through the decades
                  talked in his presence with advisers </span><span

                  hot button topics as sending in troops in Little Rock
                  to enforce school integration, the civil rights
                  marches as it politically affected their
                  administrations, the Vietnam War and its divisiveness
                  for the country and their political careers, and how
                  to respond to apartheid in South Africa.<br>

                  Alan Rickman unable to capture much about Reagan that
                  seemed real, and the John Cusack portrayal of Nixon is
                  simply a dreadful one that never clicked even though
                  his Nixon had the best skit as played out in the

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Forest Whitaker wasn't in
                  this film, it would have been a misfire. But he's in
                  this film and gives the well-meaning but lackluster
                  pic some of the gravitas it deserves, of giving the
                  general public some idea what the black staff in the
                  WH was thinking about while so obediently serving
                  their presidents and maintaining a positive image of
                  being hard working respectable family orientated
                  blacks in a rapidly changing America. Unfortunately I
                  felt more manipulated than moved, and felt the pic
                  tried covering too much ground for its own good (the
                  story of how the butler became estranged from his
                  Freedom Marcher older son Louis (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">David Oyelowo</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">) had enough material that
                  it could have been a separate melodramatic film).
                  Though the pic's strongest scene, had an angered Oprah
                  slap her militant son for dissing his dad as a house
                  nigger --pointing out that he's the one who fed him
                  and gave him everything he had, and paid for his Fisk
                  College education that he spurned to save America's

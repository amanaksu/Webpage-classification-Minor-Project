                  that was panned upon its release and then banned for
                  decades by the censors. Much later it was re-released
                  and declared by some as a masterpiece. Its later

                  dark pic, set entirely at the busy main Cairo railway
                  station. </b><b>Chahine's atmospheric chaotic railway
                  station sets the tone to depict an Egyptian society in
                  flux. The misfit crippled resides in a makeshift shack
                  by the tracks, that has bikini-dressed western women
                  as pin-up cutups plastered on his walls. </b><b>Rostom


                  engagingly plays the childishly cruel flirt who drives

                  how much he lusts for her and no matter if he offers
                  her his mother's valued expensive necklace or his
                  promises of providing security, a house and family for
                  her. The porter is the third leg of the triangle, a
                  figure of the ambitious working-class trying to make a
                  career that pays enough wages so he has a respectable

                  perhaps, most admirable, is that Chahine's film
                  surprises by filling the screen for an Arab movie with
                  so many sexually suggestive scenes and such a vivid
                  portrayal of a psychotic mentality by the rejects of
                  Egypt. I think it's easy to over-rate the film because
                  of those surprise glimpses at the disenfranchised
                  Egyptians who are invisible in the under-belly of
                  Egyptian society and thereby pass over some of the
                  film's more awkward storytelling moments.<br>

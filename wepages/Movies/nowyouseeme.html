                  explanation of the magic performed, seemingly at every
                  magical turn. The </span><span style="font-weight:

                  agitated stage because the magicians are always a step

                  attention and making fools of the cops by playing cat

                  Horsemen find a way to divest the oily Tressler of
                  over 140 million dollars and place the money into the
                  accounts of victims of Hurricane Katrina who were
                  screwed by Tressler's insurance company. In their last
                  stage act in the Big Apple, the group rob the vault of
                  a corrupt NYC company that manufactures chintzy
                  vaults. <br>

                  the group and the reasons why for these heists, is
                  about as thrilling as watching a movie about a white
                  rabbit come out of a magician's hat. The only thing
                  worth seeing in this flick is the exit sign. All the </span><span

                  because of failing health obeys doctor's orders to
                  rest and has his feisty daughter Pat (June Allyson,
                  real-life wife of Dick Powell) take over the business
                  while he's incapacitated. The only money-making

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Barry Kelley) </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">is aggressively trying to
                  get Johnny to break his contract and sign with him.
                  This has Pat go to Johnny's training camp, some 25
                  miles from the city, to deflect her rival. During a
                  sparring session Johnny injures his hand and is told
                  by his doctor (</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Frank

                  Ferguson) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">it's

                  only a bruise. Johnny then learns that though he's
                  cleared to fight, he has suffered permanent bone
                  damage as a result of previous fights and his career
                  could end at any moment. The doctor agrees to keep
                  this medical report secret. Johnny then signs a
                  lucrative contract with Goff, as he gets a guaranteed
                  income upon retirement. I guess the big-time promoter
                  couldn't afford to get a doctor to give his new
                  fighter a physical. <br>

              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Also at the training camp
                  is the well-educated heavy drinking sports writer </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Rick Gavery (Dick Powell),
                  who nurses a secret crush on Pat but feels he can't
                  compete with the famous fighter. Things get tense when
                  the troubled fighter pushes his writer friend away
                  from him, as he goes on a rant about gringos keeping
                  Mexicans down. When Sean learns of the betrayal by
                  Johnny, he dies of a broken heart. An irate Pat
                  accuses Johnny of killing her dad. Then Johnny's
                  twisted thinking has him purposely losing his title
                  fight and thereby quitting boxing, even though there's
                  no more damage to his hand. An overwrought soppy
                  climax has the three warring parties become
                  reconciled. <br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">When compared with the
                  previous year's boxing pic, The Set-Up, this one pales
                  considerably. What's interesting, though, is there's a
                  provocative inter-racial theme where none of the
                  featured whites are bigots. In the end, the insecure
                  dark skinned immigrant, with a chip on his shoulder,
                  wins the unprejudiced white skinned American
                  sweetheart. That must have been something different
                  for its 1950's audience to take in. Too bad the pic
                  didn't have enough fight in its melodramatics to go
                  the distance and win a decision on points, as its
                  right cross looked suspect.<br>

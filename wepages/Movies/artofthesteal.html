                  style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Albert Barnes came from
                  a working-class family and became a medical doctor and
                  medical researcher, and through founding a </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">pharmaceutical firm became
                  a wealthy self-made tycoon and collector of art. The
                  good liberal doctor was a man of superior taste and
                  through collecting the art of </span><span

                  other great artists before they became popular and
                  before the museums were great collectors, watched his
                  impeccable art collection become better than any
                  museum in the world. Barnes hated the phoniness of the
                  art establishment and especially the snooty </span><span

                    Art and in 1922, in opposition to the prominent
                    public galleries, opened, in the close-by Philly
                    suburb of </span></span><span style="font-weight:

                  id="movieSynopsisRemaining" style=""><span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">a private gallery that
                    was visited by serious art lovers and students by
                    invitation only. When Barnes was killed in a car
                    accident in 1951, at age 78, the married man with no
                    children </span></span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">stipulated in his will that his paintings could
                  never be loaned, sold or otherwise removed from the
                  building specifically built to house them. Furthermore
                  Barnes left control of his collection in the hands of
                  Lincoln University, a small black school, who became
                  the trustees for this valued collection that the
                  blue-bloods of Philly wanted so badly. Things went
                  well when Barnes' disciple, </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Violette de Mazia, took
                  over and ran the Barnes Foundation as an art school in
                  the exact way the founder wanted it to be run. But
                  when she died in 1988, at age 89, the operation of
                  running the collection fell into the hands of the
                  Lincoln trustees and the ambitious trustee </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Richard H. Glanton soon
                  became the head trustee and conspired to change the
                  terms of the will and invite the public into the
                  gallery. He found ways to take the collection on a
                  world tour and did everything he could to cash in on
                  the art collection. Glanton even partnered with those
                  establishment figures Barnes hated and never trusted.
                  Eventually Glanton was given the boot for losing a
                  civil-law suit against the citizens of Merion, by
                  falsely playing the race card. But his removal only
                  made it possible for the under-funded Lincoln
                  University to be hustled by politicians like the
                  bullying governor Ed Rendell and the powerful Pew
                  Foundation run by Ms. Rimer, and they hijacked the
                  invaluable collection for a song of over $100 million

                  classic American story of greed, and how in a period
                  of over fifty years some yahoo wily politicians
                  collaborated with the money people and with the
                  established art world behind them, and pulled the wool
                  over the eyes of the legal system to change a will.
                  They won despite opposed by the good guys (friends of
                  the Barnes Foundation) who were art lovers capably
                  represented by lawyers and had the law on their side.
                  If that doesn't get art lovers hopping mad, I don't
                  know what will.</span></p>

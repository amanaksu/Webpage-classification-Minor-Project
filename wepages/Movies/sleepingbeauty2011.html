                  critically acclaimed Australian film by a Jane Campion
                  approved </b><b>novelist turned writer and director,
                </b><b>Julia Leigh,</b><b> wallows in the mud as a sicko

                  and has little to say about feminist issues it
                  pretends to be concerned about. I found the
                  filmmaker's arty treatment of an impoverished dullard
                  college coed, Lucy (Emily Browning, former child
                  actress), finding a supplemental job to her daytime
                  jobs as a guinea pig for test tube experiments in

                  office job by taking on nighttime exploitation work
                  through answering her college newspaper ad, whereby
                  she is paid handsomely to be drugged into being
                  comatose overnight in a country mansion brothel run by
                  the regal businesslike madame Clara (</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Rachael Blake</span><b>).
                  The oily old men clients, with sexual liabilities,
                  sleep with her corpse-like body and roughly, for the
                  most part, fondle her, but according to brothel rules
                  can't penetrate her. Lucy goes human by showing
                  affection for her platonic dying alcoholic friend </b><span

                  visits and gives him needed cuddles.<br>
                </span></p>
              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>It was
                  baffling to see where the film-maker was going with
                  such a degrading and tiresome premise. The child
                  actress should hold out for better parts, because
                  being in films like this one and her prior Sucker
                  Punch, could be career closers. It was hard to care
                  about Lucy, as she's abrasive, flighty and poorly
                  sketched. I have no idea what makes her take such a
                  risky job, and when she asks what goes on while she
                  sleeps the malevolent madame tells her she can't know
                  because the clients would fear blackmail. The
                  low-concept movie might have seemed to have
                  possibilities as a working idea, but as a film it
                  doesn't have any juice to justify its ugliness. Though
                  I must say some critics </b><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;"> have compared it to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel&#8217;s
                  &#8216;Belle de Jour&#8217; (1967), something I don't see. But if
                  you get past how perverse and tiresome it is, I
                  suppose you give it credit for trying to offer more
                  than cheap thrills, But I just can't figure out what
                  that allegorical more is.<br>

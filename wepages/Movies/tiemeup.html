                  into a kinky romcom that examines such things as the
                  power struggle between the sexes, the side-effects
                  from the addictions of sex and drugs, and the mad
                  quest to be normal in a conformist society. It was a
                  big hit in Spain, but when released abroad it raised
                  controversial questions over a marriage kindled
                  through a kidnapping that left a bad taste in the
                  mouth of many. </b><b>Almodovar offers no ethical
                  opinion on the controversy raised, he just goes Bunuel
                  on us to present a lurid black comedy about the many
                  sides of love. The plot is similar to John Fowles' the

                  story film called "Midnight Phantom," with
                  wheelchair-bound, recovering from a stroke, aging,

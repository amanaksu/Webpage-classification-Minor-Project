                  Autry and his sidekick Frog (</b><b>Smiley Burnette)
                  and their friends are struggling horse-traders from
                  Rainbow Valley, who trek while singing to nearby
                  Grangeville to sell their horses to the farmers. At an
                  auction, after the traditional Old Barn Dance, Gene
                  fails to sell any horses as the wary farmers buy
                  Mammoth Tractors sold by the oily owner Thornton (Ivan
                  Miller). Meanwhile the invalid Dawson (</b><b>Frank
                  Darien</b><b>) has put every cent he has into a
                  struggling radio station and needs sponsors

                  the unpaid equipment</span><b>. Dawson's daughter
                  Sally (</b><b>Helen Valkis</b><b>) is told by Thornton
                  that if she can get Gene to sing on her radio program,
                  he will sign on as sponsor. Gene, desperate for cash,
                  is willing to sing if not sponsored by the tractor
                  company. But Sally fools him, and as Gene hits the
                  road selling horses he's unaware his show is sponsored
                  by Thornton's tractors. Thornton's sleazy finance
                  partner Maxwell (</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"
                  class="itemprop" itemprop="name">Hooper Atchley</span><b>)
                  threatens during harvest time to take away the
                  tractors from the farmers for failing to pay the money
                  owed on their time-shared investment; that is, unless
                  they sign to give up their crops. The irate farmers,
                  led by Clem (</b><b>Earl Dwire</b><b>), attack Gene
                  and tell him that some never would have bought the
                  tractors if it weren't for hearing him on radio
                  sponsored by Mammoth. To save his good name, Gene
                  figures a way to put the corrupt businessmen and their
                  goon, Buck (</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Raphael



                  Bennett</span><b>), out of business, as they vandalize
                  the radio station and smash all Gene's records. They
                  also get the help of Sally's kid brother Johnny (</b><b>Sammy
                  McKim</b><b>), who gets on record Buck and Thornton
                  talking about how Buck stampeded Gene's herd--which
                  was to be used at the harvest instead of the
                  confiscated tractors. Thereby the good guys get the
                  law on their side and the rest predictably ends up
                  happily resolved like all of Autry's pics.<br>

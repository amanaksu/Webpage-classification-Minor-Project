                  western outlaws some political cover by claiming they

                  part of the war effort as Rebels. Cole is willing to
                  go along with the amnesty and adjust to the changing
                  industrial times, while Jesse turns into a mystic

                  leave Missouri and go north into Yankee territory to
                  rob the bank in Northfield, Minnesota, rumored to be
                  the biggest bank west of the Mississippi, but because
                  of the amnesty forsakes his plans. After Cole is
                  wounded by a Pinkerton agent during a flareup at a
                  cathouse, Jesse, learning of Cole's robbery plans,

                  there without Cole to do the job. But Cole changes his
                  mind when he learns the speaker of the house has
                  thwarted the amnesty deal, and hopes this last bank
                  robbery will give him enough coin to bribe the
                  legislature to pass amnesty. Both gangs meet in
                  Northfield, where the botched robbery results in the
                  capture of the entire Younger gang and the escape of

                  sentenced to a 25-year prison term, and died in 1916;
                  while Jesse was shot in the back six years later by
                  new gang member Bob Ford. The Minnesota bank robbery
                  was the last one by the notorious outlaws. <br>

                  non-violent businessman-like outlaw ready to live in a

                  change his set ways. The derivative film works in
                  parts, as its memorable bank heist is impressively
                  shot and its baseball sketch is cartoonishly funny.</b></p>

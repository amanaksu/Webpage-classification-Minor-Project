                  director James Wan </b><b>("Saw"/"Dead
                  Silence"/"Death Sentence") has another go at making a
                  haunted house paranormal pic that's not a splat pic
                  and succeeds in bringing about a fair amount of
                  old-school chills in this B-film without resorting to
                  bloody gore. Sibling writers Carey and Chad Hayes
                  effectively build the tension until its climax reminds
                  one of The Exorcist. It's based on the true
                  experiences of </b><span style="font-weight: bold;">the
                  selfless and intrepid Monroe, Connecticut, residing
                  paranormal investigator Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and
                  his clairvoyant wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga), who help
                  those in deep trouble over their possessed houses.
                  These practicing Catholics are eccentric but respected
                  demonologists, who have devoted their life to fighting
                  evil. The couple also worked the latter, more
                  well-known, Amityville Horror case. Though true it
                  still seems as if the pic has used a host of other
                  Hollywood eerie ghost stories to get across its scary
                  moments. Wan, to his credit, treats the tale about a
                  house possessed by demons and one that only can be
                  cleansed by a religious exorcism, with utmost
                  seriousness. <br>

                  young daughters, the oldest is a high school student

                  in Harrisville, R.I., in the fall of 1971, and
                  immediately discover that the idyllic bargain house
                  they bought through foreclosure from the bank without
                  knowing its historical connections to the Salem Witch
                  Trials is haunted. The early demonic manifestations
                  include their pet dog mutilated, a locked cellar
                  filled with frightening junk, a coldness that can't be
                  removed from the house, strange smells, clocks
                  stopping during the night, thumping sounds, doors
                  opening and closing on their own, the girls unable to
                  sleep without feeling someone else was present in the
                  room, and there are mysterious dark bruises appearing
                  on Carolyn&#8217;s body. </span><br>

                  to investigate the Perron house and when they realize
                  it's possessed, temporarily move in with the Perrons
                  to investigate further and offer support.&nbsp;
                  Learning about the house&#8217;s chilling history that
                  includes witchcraft, suicide and satanic ritual
                  murder, the couple, along with an investigative
                  assistant (Shannon Kook) and a skeptical cop (John
                  Brotherton), use tape recorders and cameras to bring
                  evidence to get the Catholic Church to sanction an
                  exorcism. The Warrens believe the Perron family is in
                  grave danger and must rid themselves of the possession
                  or face deadly consequences.</span><br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">It turns into a battle of
                  Evil vs. Good pic, and provides enough creaky noises
                  and supernatural scares to be a throwback film to
                  those kind of enjoyable horror pics in the 1970s. Wan
                  has said he intended to make a &#8220;classic studio horror
                  film,&#8221; and he certainly accomplished that.</span></p>

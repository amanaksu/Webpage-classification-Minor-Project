                  carpenter, and not trying to use education to be

                  figment of Govert's disturbed mind or what's really
                  happening. Told from the beginning through a flashback
                  when our hero is incarcerated in a mental asylum, it
                  plays on the theme that we make ourselves unhappy
                  chasing illusions, cause ourselves inner conflicts
                  unnecessarily and cannot be content with our lot in
                  life in this too vague of a world. The drama, of a

                  a superbly moving performance by </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Senne Rouffaer, it's
                  gorgeously filmed in black and white, the storytelling
                  is passionate, mesmerizing and intelligent, and the
                  complex nature explored of how alienated the
                  hypersensitive can become when left alone to their own
                  psychological torments is well-worth telling. This
                  uniquely presented unsettling film of a mentally
                  fragile man trying to find and hold onto his identity
                  is as good a study of man's restless and abnormal
                  nature that I have ever encountered in movies, and
                  remains one of the great but little known films.
                  Though highly acclaimed when re-evaluated by critics
                  after it was rebuked at its theater release, it has

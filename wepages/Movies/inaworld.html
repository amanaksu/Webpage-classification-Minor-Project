                  style="font-weight: bold;">Lake Bell is a New
                  York-born actress who studied acting at the London
                  theater conservatory. She's
                  writer-director-star-producer of this engaging indie
                  comedy, her debut directorial feature. It's a
                  well-conceived and acted female empowerment tale that
                  smartly answers its question of why women are rarely
                  hired to do the voice-overs of trailers. It's about a
                  struggling underachiever LA-based voice coach, Carol
                  Solomon (Lake Bell), and her awkward relationship with
                  her unsupportive egotistical famous voice-over widowed
                  father Sam (</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fred

                  Melamed</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">)--their

                  dysfunctional relationship serves as a metaphor for
                  the 'old boys' club' world that discriminates against
                  women in the job world. </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Bell won the Sundance 2013
                  Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award for her refreshing
                  script.</span></p>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">It's a goofy but perceptive
                  movie that seduced me to take an interest in the world
                  of voiceovers, holding my interest throughout even if
                  I initially could care less about voiceover artists.

                  artists of movie trailers, </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Don LaFontaine, who was the
                  most revered in his field until his death in 2008 and
                  who coined the term used for the title.<br>

                  Carol living at home with her reigning 'king of the
                  voiceovers' dad, and at work coaching up the actress </span><span

                  style="font-weight: bold;"> Louis (Demetri Martin) is
                  a first-class sound engineer who's attracted to Carol

                  mix-ups over the no-name Carol getting the gig over
                  the wealthy arrogant noted voice-over artist Gustave

                  booming baritone voiced dad's surprising negative
                  reaction to his daughter's good fortune that leads him
                  to also vindictively apply for that important gig to
                  beat out his daughter even after she's promised the
                  job.<br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">It hits home with its
                  relevant story that includes caveats about a
                  cautionary romance, family dysfunction, marital woes,
                  the cutthroat competition in the voice-over field,
                  sexism in the job market and an expose of how women
                  are getting the shaft in the voice-over world by the
                  men who run things. Bell fights back with humor,
                  perseverance and care for her craft, as she gleefully
                  and wisely tells us the world is slowly changing and
                  that women have come a long way but there's still
                  progress to look forward to ahead. <br>

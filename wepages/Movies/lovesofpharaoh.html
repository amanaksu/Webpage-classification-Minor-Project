              <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>This
                  silent Hollywood style epic is the last film legendary
                  director Ernst Lubitsch</b> <b>("Trouble in
                  Paradise"/"Design for Living"/"The Merry Widow") made
                  in Germany before coming to America.&nbsp;</b><b> With
                  this pic, taking ten months to complete, Lubitsch</b><b>
                  proved to the Hollywood suits he can make a Hollywood
                  blockbuster. It's an ornate costume piece, with a cast
                  in the thousands for the mob scenes. The only
                  difference between this German made big scale venture
                  and a Hollywood one, is that this is a much more
                  sophisticated epic and features the renown Lubitsch
                  Touch: elegance, wit and great dialog. It also differs
                  because it surprises with an unhappy ending, something
                  frowned upon by Hollywood's suits. The screenplay is
                  attributed to </b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Norbert

                  Falk and Hanns Krly. </span><b>At the time it was the
                  most lavish production in Germany. Though the pic was
                  lost for many years, it was restored in 2005 by a
                  German company. Unfortunately the original was lost
                  and parts were never recovered. The film was
                  reconstructed by reassembling prints found in
                  different parts of the world and where there were
                  gaps, stills were used. <br>

                  only if he pardons Ramphis from a death sentence,
                  which he reduces to a life sentence of hard labor. <br>

                  masses for the war and why so many warriors lost their
                  lives. When Theonis refuses to swear she will have no

                  style="font-weight: bold;">After defeating the
                  Ethiopians because of the heroics and leadership of
                  Ramphis and the presumed death of Amenes, the upstart
                  is made the new pharaoh. In a confusing last turn, the
                  love-stricken Amenes turns up suddenly alive and the
                  priest (F</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">riedrich

                  Khne</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">), evoking
                  that god talks through him, declares that according to
                  divine law Theonis is still married to Amenes and
                  thereby voids her marriage to Ramphis. The tragic
                  ending that ensues with this change of events comes as
                  a shocker.<br>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Dagny Servaes got the
                  starring role when the great actress Pola Negri wasn't
                  available, and some critics think that role would have
                  been considerably stronger if acted by Negri.</span></p>

              <p><b>One of the best of the cliffhanger serials (if not,
                  indeed,
                  the best);
                  it shows all 15-chapters that used to play before the
                  double-features
                  on
                  Saturday matinees back in the day. It's action-packed
                  as codirected by
                  Spencer Gordon Bennet and Thomas Carr and scripted
                  from a team of
                  writers
                  who based it on the Superman radio shows (which were
                  based on the
                  Action
                  comic book series). Former B-film star Kirk Alyn is an
                  engaging and
                  athletic
                  Superman; he came before George Reeves and Christopher
                  Reeve to set the
                  standard for the role. The rest of the cast are not
                  that polished but
                  most
                  get the job done by playing within their limits. Noel
                  Neill (recreated
                  the role for 1950s TV) makes for a feisty and rather
                  dumb ace reporter,
                  Lois Lane, who unintentionally ends up helping the
                  villains more than
                  she
                  does Superman. Carol Forman plays the sinister
                  arch-villain Spider Lady
                  who plans to bring Superman down with a new weapon
                  called the
                  relativity
                  reducer ray and thereby control the planet. Her
                  performance was too
                  stiff
                  and joyless for what was needed, but the film makes up
                  for her weak
                  performance
                  by providing plenty of action whenever she shows her
                  masked face. Cub
                  reporter
                  Jimmy Olsen plays the good-natured dolt to perfection,
                  while Pierre
                  Watkin
                  is fine as Perry White the harried editor of the Daily
                  Planet. Superman
                  is animated while in flight, which I thought was very
                  well done. One
                  has
                  to remember this black and white film comes way before
                  the advances in
                  special effects due to computers.&nbsp;</b> </p>
              <p><b>In these nailbiting episodes, with titles such as
                  "Superman
                  Comes
                  to Earth" and "A Job for Superman," we trace
                  Superman's origins from
                  the
                  doomed planet Krypton, his scientist father Jor-El
                  warning the
                  unresponsive
                  leaders to evacuate because of the imminent dangers of
                  Krypton being
                  destroyed
                  by the natural evolution that can't be prevented, the
                  space ship
                  venture
                  as an infant for the future Superman to safety on
                  Earth after the
                  mineral
                  rich Krypton is pulled toward the sun and explodes,
                  and Krypton's only
                  survivor being adopted by the Kents (Virginia Carroll
                  &amp; Ed
                  Cassidy),
                  Kansas farmers, who name their foster son Clark. In
                  subsequent chapters
                  we follow the mild-mannered Clark Kent getting a
                  reporter's job in
                  Metropolis
                  on the Daily Planet, which he considers a good place
                  to keep an eye on
                  world affairs. There are a series of derring-do
                  heroics by the Man of
                  Steel
                  that take him "up, up and away" and make him the most
                  feared and
                  respected
                  crime fighter in the world. When the narrator says
                  "This looks like a
                  job
                  for Superman," we find Superman doing such heroic
                  things as preventing
                  a train wreck, rescuing Lois from a mine cave-in,
                  stopping bank
                  robbers,
                  foiling a prison break and so on. The main plot has to
                  do with the
                  Spider
                  Lady, "the queen of the underworld," discovering
                  Superman's one
                  weakness
                  is from Kryptonite, a mineral found in a meteorite
                  that fell on Earth,
                  which her henchmen stole from the Metropolis Museum in
                  order to stop
                  Superman
                  from preventing her from controlling the world with
                  the most deadly
                  weapon
                  in the world--the reducer ray. Superman battles the
                  villains and in the
                  end proves to be an able defender of "Truth, Justice
                  and the American
                  way."</b> </p>

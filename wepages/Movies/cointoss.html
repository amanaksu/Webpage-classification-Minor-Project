                  trying to say something significant about white collar
                  financial crime mixed with some awkward moments tied
                  up in a convoluted subplot about evil schemers.</span><span

                  Trimble &amp; </b><b>Satya Kharkar, with Ms. Trimble
                  writing the overworked screenplay. Though appealing in
                  spots, the message film (you can't buy happiness) had
                  too many rough spots to completely win me over. The
                  stilted unnatural dialogue was a turn-off, as was the
                  emotionally limited acting. Also the derivative story
                  never had a steady flow, as it kept getting
                  sidetracked with subplots that left too many loose
                  ends and clumsy sudden twists. But for those who favor
                  breezy romantic sitcoms, with a dash of screwball
                  comedy and plenty of charm, and are tired of the
                  formulaic big-budget mainstream films, this
                  competently made indie might find favor for such a
                  viewer because of its inspirational story line. Also
                  the production values were fine and the Chicago
                  location visuals were pleasing. If this small pic gets
                  to the right audience, it might find some modest
                  success.<br>

                  inheritance is up in the air because mom foolishly got
                  involved with his Chicago residing untrustworthy
                  conman billionaire cousin Doug (Brent Foster), who
                  placed her investment in an illegal pyramid scheme
                  that's investigated by the Feds. Tom goes by car with

                  the lottery doesn't mean his troubles are over, as
                  various ticklish situations arise. The story unfolds

                  Parks)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. He's
                  the good twin, while the eye patch wearing brother
                  Mortimer (both twins are played by Parks) is the evil
                  twin who stole his brother's money and ideas. We&nbsp;
                  learn that during her childhood Mia had a crush on the
                  inattentive Tom. Now, in changed circumstances, we
                  observe how a sweet romance is rekindled between the
                  two nice people and how the sympathetic Tom tries to
                  get his life back on the right track by learning the
                  real value of winning and losing. <br>

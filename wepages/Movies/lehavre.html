                  old-fashioned filming of a modern-day political fairy
                  tale for adults, delivering an overly sentimental but
                  warmhearted Marxist message pic about the necessity of
                  sticking together to fight for your rights. Finnish
                  writer-director Aki Kaurismaki</b> <b>("The Man
                  Without A Past"/"Drifting Clouds"/"Leningrad Cowboys
                  Go America") in a smart-alecky but gentle way gives
                  his fantasy film a Howard Hawks Hollywood turn, as he
                  pays homage to his resistant fighter movies from WW2
                  and also offers a nod to community activists, as he
                  gleefully salivates as he presents a utopian agenda as
                  compensation for society's white guilt-trip over their
                  confusing unworkable immigration laws. The
                  tongue-in-cheek presentation astounds with a
                  simplistic social conscience story line on how reality
                  can be rosy if only people cared about each other,
                  especially those of another race. To make </b><b>Kaurismaki's

                  utopian reality obviously unreal, all those in favor
                  of refugees in France are treated as saints while
                  those opposed are viewed as if they were a Judas.<br>

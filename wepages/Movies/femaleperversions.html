                  heaviness and its pretenses. It was all about telling
                  us, whether true or not, how much more difficult it
                  still is for a women to fit into a man's world. A
                  message I could buy into, but I couldn't buy into how
                  tiresome the pic looked despite Swinton providing her
                  usual good performance and all the passion on display
                  through graphic heated affairs. But it failed to leave
                  me thinking more about gender relationships, as I
                  suppose it thought it would. Instead I found its
                  audacious presentation weakest when it went into a
                  dross fantasy role playing mode and strongest when
                  allowing us to witness how crafty a woman must be to
                  climb the ladder of success.<br>

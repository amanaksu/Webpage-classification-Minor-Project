                  Jim to a duel for having the audacity to speak up for
                  the artist. Jim somehow is able to use his wit to call
                  off the duel, and soon becomes friends with Narcisse
                  and pursues his beautiful but spoiled sister Judalon.

                  duel. When Narcisse intervenes, he's killed when
                  confronting Contrecourt. Jim, in the film's best

                  chamber. Surprisingly Jim kills Contrecourt.
                  Afterwards Jim sells the family lumber mill for a
                  healthy profit and talks his family into buying bayou

                  his business. Jim buys a racehorse and beats Moreno's

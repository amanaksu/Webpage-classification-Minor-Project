                  Blood"/"Kid Galahad"/"Adventures of Robin Hood") makes
                  his American directorial debut with this ambitious
                  epic, an attempt at another Intolerance that fails,
                  but the studio likes that he brings the pic home on
                  schedule and on budget. The part-talkie film was
                  restored in 1989 and reduced from 135 minutes to 100
                  minutes. After hearing its silent star Dolores
                  Costello's squeaky voice, I would have cut her talkie
                  part out and saved her some embarrassment with the new
                  medium. Though its story is naive, to say the least,
                  it at least pleases with its visual splendor, immense
                  mob scenes, a scary deluge scene (where crew members
                  were supposedly killed or injured), some sparkling war
                  scenes in the trenches and a great train wreck. Warner

                  style="font-weight: bold;">It opens in 1914, when a
                  train from </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Constantinople



                  to Paris derails and two carefree vacationing American
                  young travelers, Travis (</span><span

                  style="font-weight: bold;">an Alsatian girl named Mary
                  (</span><b>Dolores Costello</b><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">) who is pinned under the
                  train debris. The survivors find shelter at an inn
                  near the French frontier and soon learn war has been
                  declared. The innkeeper helps the trio escape a
                  cavalry raid. In Paris, Travis falls in love with
                  Mary, but is swept away with patriotism and both
                  Travis and Al enlist in the army leaving Mary on her
                  own. Mary </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">searches
                  for Travis while working as a canteen dancer in
                  France. When she rejects the sexual advances of a

                  Beery</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">), he
                  reports her as a German spy. On the eve of her
                  execution, Travis appears and makes all good.
                  Meanwhile the pic runs parallel to the </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">World War I story the
                  biblical account of the flood, where we view such

                  style="font-weight: bold;">as a human sacrifice.&nbsp;
                  We also observe that on the outskirts of town, the

                  learn that the beautiful Miriam (</span><span

                  style="font-weight: bold;">George O'Brien</span><span

                  take her captive and the king (</span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Noah Beery) </span><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">has her prepared for the
                  sacrifice to his false gods. Noah is tuned into the
                  true God and under his orders builds an Ark, and
                  before the pagan high priest (</span><strong>Nigel De

                  execute Miriam he's killed by a lightning bolt and a
                  second bolt takes care of the idol. The temple is
                  flooded and all kinds of miracles take place, as the
                  true believers are rescued in the Ark. In the
                  modern-day story, we observe the good deeds of the Red
                  Cross workers administering to the wounded and then
                  the Armistice brings on a celebration for peace. Both
                  tales tell of how evil is expunged by the forces of
                  good.<br>

                  this is a wonderfully idiotic campy Hollywood
                  spectacle film whose appeal is to those who can't look
                  away from a train wreck to enjoy gaudy spectacle. <br>

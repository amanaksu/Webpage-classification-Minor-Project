                  called the Man. He's an untrustworthy womanizing twit
                  and professional charmer, who is a thirtysomething
                  college professor and magazine writer about to get
                  married and goes on a X-cross-country trip to visit
                  his significant former girlfriends, not seen for a
                  long time, to chat them up and ask forgiveness if he
                  hurt them by dumping them. The Brody character's

                  and his gift of gab leaves him looking like a weaselly
                  unsympathetic shit. It was hard to connect with the
                  Brody character, except to acknowledge there are
                  unfortunately other despicable characters like him in
                  real-life and the playwright does a good job in
                  nailing the character.<br>

                  out from NYC to return to his hometown of Seattle, and
                  arranges meetings with five former flames in hotel
                  rooms. First up, he explains to high school girlfriend

                  why he didn't take her to the prom some fifteen years
                  ago and left her in the lurch. Next is the Chicago
                  residing Tyler (</span><span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">M&iacute;a Maestro</span><span

                  choice. In Boston, he revisits the irate older college
                  professor </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lindsay

                  (Emily Watson), whom he had a steamy affair with even
                  though her husband, the college dean, hired him. She
                  absurdly devises some sexual way to get payback for
                  his mistreatment during the hotel visit. Returning to

                  vulnerable when he came sexually onto his best
                  friend's kid sister and then split without a word
                  leaving her psychologically wounded. The final visit
                  is with the attractive Los Angeles nurse Bobbi (</span><span

                  prompted him to leave her, as he tells her that he
                  still loves her more than any other. This episode
                  brings out the darkest side of our anti-hero, who is
                  depicted as a user of people and a snake-like

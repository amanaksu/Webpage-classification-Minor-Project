                  stagecoaches and payroll deliveries. When crusading
                  editor George Daniels is killed by the gang, deputy
                  marshal Eddie Dean is called from Tombstone. While
                  en-route Eddie discovers a four-man gang is waiting in
                  ambush to kill the stagecoach passenger Carole

                  and is informed by the crooked family lawyer Cochrane
                  (Eddie Parker) that Carole's dad is dead due to an
                  explosion at his ranch. We learn he was killed by the
                  gang when he discovered they were using a cave on his
                  ranch property as a hideout. It's further learned that

                  both her uncle and his daughter and inherit the
                  richest ranch in the territory. Though the gang was
                  recruited with the help of her boyfriend Cochrane,
                  Vivian has other ambitions than marrying him now.<br>

                  Vivian is friendly with only the bad cowhands on the
                  H-Bar 2 Ranch. Their spying enables them to soon get a
